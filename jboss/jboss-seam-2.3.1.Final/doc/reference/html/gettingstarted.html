        generate some simple Seam skeleton code, and reverse engineer an application from a preexisting database.</p><p>This is the easy way to get your feet wet with Seam, and gives you some ammunition for next time you find
        yourself trapped in an elevator with one of those tedious Ruby guys ranting about how great and wonderful his
        new toy is for building totally trivial applications that put things in databases.</p><p>In this release, seam-gen works best for people with JBoss AS. You can use the generated project with other
        J2EE or Java EE 5 application servers by making a few manual changes to the project configuration.</p><p>You <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> use seam-gen without Eclipse, but in this tutorial, we want to show you how to
        use it in conjunction with Eclipse for debugging and integration testing. If you don't want to install Eclipse,
        you can still follow along with this tutorial—all steps can be performed from the command line.</p><p>seam-gen is basically just an intricate Ant script wrapped around Hibernate Tools, together with some templates.
        That makes it easy to customize if you need to.</p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d0e2691"/>2.1. Before you start</h2></div></div></div><p>Make sure you have JDK 6 (see <a class="xref" href="dependencies.html#jdk_dependencies" title="39.1. JDK Dependencies">Section 39.1, “JDK Dependencies”</a> for details), JBoss AS 7.1.1 and Maven 3.x, along with recent versions of
            Eclipse, the JBoss IDE plugin for Eclipse correctly installed before
            starting. Add your JBoss installation to the JBoss Server View in Eclipse. Start JBoss in debug mode.
            Finally, start a command prompt in the directory where you unzipped the Seam distribution.</p><p>JBoss has sophisticated support for hot re-deployment of WARs and EARs. Unfortunately, due to bugs in the
            JVM, repeated redeployment of an EAR—which is common during development—eventually causes the JVM to run out
            of perm gen space. For this reason, we recommend running JBoss in a JVM with a large perm gen space at
            development time. If you're running JBoss from JBoss IDE, you can configure this in the server launch
            configuration, under "VM arguments". We suggest the following values:</p><pre class="programlisting">-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m</pre><p>If you don't have so much memory available, the following is our minimum recommendation:</p><pre class="programlisting">-Xms256m -Xmx512m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m</pre><p>If you're running JBoss from the command line, you can configure the JVM options in
            <code class="literal">bin/standalone.conf</code>.</p><p>If you don't want to bother with this stuff now, you don't have to—come back to it later, when you get
            your first <code class="literal">OutOfMemoryException</code>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d0e2716"/>2.2. Setting up a new project</h2></div></div></div><p>The first thing we need to do is configure seam-gen for your environment: JBoss AS installation directory,
