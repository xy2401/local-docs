<p>Spring Security&#8217;s web infrastructure is based entirely on standard servlet filters. It doesn&#8217;t use servlets or any other servlet-based frameworks (such as Spring MVC) internally, so it has no strong links to any particular web technology. It deals in <code class="literal">HttpServletRequest</code> s and <code class="literal">HttpServletResponse</code> s and doesn&#8217;t care whether the requests come from a browser, a web service client, an <code class="literal">HttpInvoker</code> or an AJAX application.</p>
<p>Spring Security maintains a filter chain internally where each of the filters has a particular responsibility and filters are added or removed from the configuration depending on which services are required. The ordering of the filters is important as there are dependencies between them. If you have been using <a class="link" href="ns-config.html" title="6.&nbsp;Security Namespace Configuration">namespace configuration</a>, then the filters are automatically configured for you and you don&#8217;t have to define any Spring beans explicitly but here may be times when you want full control over the security filter chain, either because you are using features which aren&#8217;t supported in the namespace, or you are using your own customized versions of classes.</p>
<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="delegating-filter-proxy" href="#delegating-filter-proxy"></a>13.1&nbsp;DelegatingFilterProxy</h2></div></div></div>

<p>When using servlet filters, you obviously need to declare them in your <code class="literal">web.xml</code>, or they will be ignored by the servlet container. In Spring Security, the filter classes are also Spring beans defined in the application context and thus able to take advantage of Spring&#8217;s rich dependency-injection facilities and lifecycle interfaces. Spring&#8217;s <code class="literal">DelegatingFilterProxy</code> provides the link between <code class="literal">web.xml</code> and the application context.</p>
<p>When using <code class="literal">DelegatingFilterProxy</code>, you will see something like this in the <code class="literal">web.xml</code> file:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><span class="hl-tag">&lt;filter&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;filter-name&gt;</span>myFilter<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/filter-name&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;filter-class&gt;</span>org.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/filter-class&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/filter&gt;</span>

<span class="hl-tag">&lt;filter-mapping&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;filter-name&gt;</span>myFilter<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/filter-name&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;url-pattern&gt;</span>/*<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/url-pattern&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/filter-mapping&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Notice that the filter is actually a <code class="literal">DelegatingFilterProxy</code>, and not the class that will actually implement the logic of the filter. What <code class="literal">DelegatingFilterProxy</code> does is delegate the <code class="literal">Filter</code> 's methods through to a bean which is obtained from the Spring application context. This enables the bean to benefit from the Spring web application context lifecycle support and configuration flexibility. The bean must implement <code class="literal">javax.servlet.Filter</code> and it must have the same name as that in the <code class="literal">filter-name</code> element. Read the Javadoc for <code class="literal">DelegatingFilterProxy</code> for more information</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="filter-chain-proxy" href="#filter-chain-proxy"></a>13.2&nbsp;FilterChainProxy</h2></div></div></div>

<p>Spring Security&#8217;s web infrastructure should only be used by delegating to an instance of <code class="literal">FilterChainProxy</code>. The security filters should not be used by themselves. In theory you could declare each Spring Security filter bean that you require in your application context file and add a corresponding <code class="literal">DelegatingFilterProxy</code> entry to <code class="literal">web.xml</code> for each filter, making sure that they are ordered correctly, but this would be cumbersome and would clutter up the <code class="literal">web.xml</code> file quickly if you have a lot of filters. <code class="literal">FilterChainProxy</code> lets us add a single entry to <code class="literal">web.xml</code> and deal entirely with the application context file for managing our web security beans. It is wired using a <code class="literal">DelegatingFilterProxy</code>, just like in the example above, but with the <code class="literal">filter-name</code> set to the bean name "filterChainProxy". The filter chain is then declared in the application context with the same bean name. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><span class="hl-tag">&lt;bean</span> <span class="hl-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hl-value">"filterChainProxy"</span> <span class="hl-attribute">class</span>=<span class="hl-value">"org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy"</span><span class="hl-tag">&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;constructor-arg&gt;</span>
	<span class="hl-tag">&lt;list&gt;</span>
	<span class="hl-tag">&lt;sec:filter-chain</span> <span class="hl-attribute">pattern</span>=<span class="hl-value">"/restful/**"</span> <span class="hl-attribute">filters</span>=<span class="hl-value">"
		securityContextPersistenceFilterWithASCFalse,
		basicAuthenticationFilter,
		exceptionTranslationFilter,
		filterSecurityInterceptor"</span><span class="hl-tag"> /&gt;</span>
	<span class="hl-tag">&lt;sec:filter-chain</span> <span class="hl-attribute">pattern</span>=<span class="hl-value">"/**"</span> <span class="hl-attribute">filters</span>=<span class="hl-value">"
		securityContextPersistenceFilterWithASCTrue,
		formLoginFilter,
		exceptionTranslationFilter,
		filterSecurityInterceptor"</span><span class="hl-tag"> /&gt;</span>
	<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/list&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/constructor-arg&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/bean&gt;</span></pre>
<p>The namespace element <code class="literal">filter-chain</code> is used for convenience to set up the security filter chain(s) which are required within the application. <a href="#ftn.d5e2430" class="footnote" name="d5e2430"><sup class="footnote">[6]</sup></a>. It maps a particular URL pattern to a list of filters built up from the bean names specified in the <code class="literal">filters</code> element, and combines them in a bean of type <code class="literal">SecurityFilterChain</code>. The <code class="literal">pattern</code> attribute takes an Ant Paths and the most specific URIs should appear first  <a href="#ftn.d5e2436" class="footnote" name="d5e2436"><sup class="footnote">[7]</sup></a>. At runtime the <code class="literal">FilterChainProxy</code> will locate the first URI pattern that matches the current web request and the list of filter beans specified by the <code class="literal">filters</code> attribute will be applied to that request. The filters will be invoked in the order they are defined, so you have complete control over the filter chain which is applied to a particular URL.</p>
<p>You may have noticed we have declared two <code class="literal">SecurityContextPersistenceFilter</code> s in the filter chain (<code class="literal">ASC</code> is short for <code class="literal">allowSessionCreation</code>, a property of <code class="literal">SecurityContextPersistenceFilter</code>). As web services will never present a <code class="literal">jsessionid</code> on future requests, creating <code class="literal">HttpSession</code> s for such user agents would be wasteful. If you had a high-volume application which required maximum scalability, we recommend you use the approach shown above. For smaller applications, using a single <code class="literal">SecurityContextPersistenceFilter</code> (with its default <code class="literal">allowSessionCreation</code> as <code class="literal">true</code>) would likely be sufficient.</p>
<p>Note that <code class="literal">FilterChainProxy</code> does not invoke standard filter lifecycle methods on the filters it is configured with. We recommend you use Spring&#8217;s application context lifecycle interfaces as an alternative, just as you would for any other Spring bean.</p>
<p>When we looked at how to set up web security using <a class="link" href="ns-config.html#ns-web-xml" title="6.2.1&nbsp;web.xml Configuration">namespace configuration</a>, we used a <code class="literal">DelegatingFilterProxy</code> with the name "springSecurityFilterChain". You should now be able to see that this is the name of the <code class="literal">FilterChainProxy</code> which is created by the namespace.</p>
<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bypassing-the-filter-chain" href="#bypassing-the-filter-chain"></a>13.2.1&nbsp;Bypassing the Filter Chain</h3></div></div></div>

<p>You can use the attribute <code class="literal">filters = "none"</code> as an alternative to supplying a filter bean list. This will omit the request pattern from the security filter chain entirely. Note that anything matching this path will then have no authentication or authorization services applied and will be freely accessible. If you want to make use of the contents of the <code class="literal">SecurityContext</code> contents during a request, then it must have passed through the security filter chain. Otherwise the <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder</code> will not have been populated and the contents will be null.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="filter-ordering" href="#filter-ordering"></a>13.3&nbsp;Filter Ordering</h2></div></div></div>

<p>The order that filters are defined in the chain is very important. Irrespective of which filters you are actually using, the order should be as follows:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">ChannelProcessingFilter</code>, because it might need to redirect to a different protocol
</li><li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">SecurityContextPersistenceFilter</code>, so a <code class="literal">SecurityContext</code> can be set up in the <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder</code> at the beginning of a web request, and any changes to the <code class="literal">SecurityContext</code> can be copied to the <code class="literal">HttpSession</code> when the web request ends (ready for use with the next web request)
</li><li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">ConcurrentSessionFilter</code>, because it uses the <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder</code> functionality and needs to update the <code class="literal">SessionRegistry</code> to reflect ongoing requests from the principal
</li><li class="listitem">
Authentication processing mechanisms - <code class="literal">UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter</code>, <code class="literal">CasAuthenticationFilter</code>, <code class="literal">BasicAuthenticationFilter</code> etc - so that the <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder</code> can be modified to contain a valid <code class="literal">Authentication</code> request token
</li><li class="listitem">
The <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter</code>, if you are using it to install a Spring Security aware <code class="literal">HttpServletRequestWrapper</code> into your servlet container
</li><li class="listitem">
The <code class="literal">JaasApiIntegrationFilter</code>, if a <code class="literal">JaasAuthenticationToken</code> is in the <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder</code> this will process the <code class="literal">FilterChain</code> as the <code class="literal">Subject</code> in the <code class="literal">JaasAuthenticationToken</code>
</li><li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">RememberMeAuthenticationFilter</code>, so that if no earlier authentication processing mechanism updated the <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder</code>, and the request presents a cookie that enables remember-me services to take place, a suitable remembered <code class="literal">Authentication</code> object will be put there
</li><li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">AnonymousAuthenticationFilter</code>, so that if no earlier authentication processing mechanism updated the <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder</code>, an anonymous <code class="literal">Authentication</code> object will be put there
</li><li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">ExceptionTranslationFilter</code>, to catch any Spring Security exceptions so that either an HTTP error response can be returned or an appropriate <code class="literal">AuthenticationEntryPoint</code> can be launched

</li></ul></div>

<p>Spring Security has several areas where patterns you have defined are tested against incoming requests in order to decide how the request should be handled.
This occurs when the <code class="literal">FilterChainProxy</code> decides which filter chain a request should be passed through and also when the <code class="literal">FilterSecurityInterceptor</code> decides which security constraints apply to a request.
It&#8217;s important to understand what the mechanism is and what URL value is used when testing against the patterns that you define.</p>
<p>The Servlet Specification defines several properties for the <code class="literal">HttpServletRequest</code> which are accessible via getter methods, and which we might want to match against.
These are the <code class="literal">contextPath</code>, <code class="literal">servletPath</code>, <code class="literal">pathInfo</code> and <code class="literal">queryString</code>.
Spring Security is only interested in securing paths within the application, so the <code class="literal">contextPath</code> is ignored.
Unfortunately, the servlet spec does not define exactly what the values of <code class="literal">servletPath</code> and <code class="literal">pathInfo</code> will contain for a particular request URI.
For example, each path segment of a URL may contain parameters, as defined in <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt" target="_top">RFC 2396</a>
<a href="#ftn.d5e2534" class="footnote" name="d5e2534"><sup class="footnote">[8]</sup></a>.
The Specification does not clearly state whether these should be included in the <code class="literal">servletPath</code> and <code class="literal">pathInfo</code> values and the behaviour varies between different servlet containers.
There is a danger that when an application is deployed in a container which does not strip path parameters from these values, an attacker could add them to the requested URL in order to cause a pattern match to succeed or fail unexpectedly.
<a href="#ftn.d5e2539" class="footnote" name="d5e2539"><sup class="footnote">[9]</sup></a>.
Other variations in the incoming URL are also possible.
For example, it could contain path-traversal sequences (like <code class="literal">/../</code>) or multiple forward slashes (<code class="literal">//</code>) which could also cause pattern-matches to fail.
Some containers normalize these out before performing the servlet mapping, but others don&#8217;t.
To protect against issues like these, <code class="literal">FilterChainProxy</code> uses an <code class="literal">HttpFirewall</code> strategy to check and wrap the request.
Un-normalized requests are automatically rejected by default, and path parameters and duplicate slashes are removed for matching purposes.
<a href="#ftn.d5e2546" class="footnote" name="d5e2546"><sup class="footnote">[10]</sup></a>.
It is therefore essential that a <code class="literal">FilterChainProxy</code> is used to manage the security filter chain.
Note that the <code class="literal">servletPath</code> and <code class="literal">pathInfo</code> values are decoded by the container, so your application should not have any valid paths which contain semi-colons, as these parts will be removed for matching purposes.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the default strategy is to use Ant-style paths for matching and this is likely to be the best choice for most users.
The strategy is implemented in the class <code class="literal">AntPathRequestMatcher</code> which uses Spring&#8217;s <code class="literal">AntPathMatcher</code> to perform a case-insensitive match of the pattern against the concatenated <code class="literal">servletPath</code> and <code class="literal">pathInfo</code>, ignoring the <code class="literal">queryString</code>.</p>
<p>If for some reason, you need a more powerful matching strategy, you can use regular expressions.
The strategy implementation is then <code class="literal">RegexRequestMatcher</code>.
See the Javadoc for this class for more information.</p>
<p>In practice we recommend that you use method security at your service layer, to control access to your application, and do not rely entirely on the use of security constraints defined at the web-application level.
URLs change and it is difficult to take account of all the possible URLs that an application might support and how requests might be manipulated.
You should try and restrict yourself to using a few simple ant paths which are simple to understand.
Always try to use a "deny-by-default" approach where you have a catch-all wildcard ( /<span class="strong"><strong> or </strong></span>) defined last and denying access.</p>
<p>Security defined at the service layer is much more robust and harder to bypass, so you should always take advantage of Spring Security&#8217;s method security options.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">HttpFirewall</code> also prevents <a class="ulink" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Response_Splitting" target="_top">HTTP Response Splitting</a> by rejecting new line characters in the HTTP Response headers.</p>
<p>By default the <code class="literal">StrictHttpFirewall</code> is used.
This implementation rejects requests that appear to be malicious.
If it is too strict for your needs, then you can customize what types of requests are rejected.
However, it is important that you do so knowing that this can open your application up to attacks.
For example, if you wish to leverage Spring MVC&#8217;s Matrix Variables, the following configuration could be used in XML:</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><span class="hl-tag">&lt;b:bean</span> <span class="hl-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hl-value">"httpFirewall"</span>
      <span class="hl-attribute">class</span>=<span class="hl-value">"org.springframework.security.web.firewall.StrictHttpFirewall"</span>
      <span class="hl-attribute">p:allowSemicolon</span>=<span class="hl-value">"true"</span><span class="hl-tag">/&gt;</span>

<span class="hl-tag">&lt;http-firewall</span> <span class="hl-attribute">ref</span>=<span class="hl-value">"httpFirewall"</span><span class="hl-tag">/&gt;</span></pre>
<p>The same thing can be achieved with Java Configuration by exposing a <code class="literal">StrictHttpFirewall</code> bean.</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><em><span class="hl-annotation" style="color: gray">@Bean</span></em>
<span class="hl-keyword">public</span> StrictHttpFirewall httpFirewall() {
    StrictHttpFirewall firewall = <span class="hl-keyword">new</span> StrictHttpFirewall();
    firewall.setAllowSemicolon(true);
    <span class="hl-keyword">return</span> firewall;
}</pre>

<p>If you&#8217;re using some other framework that is also filter-based, then you need to make sure that the Spring Security filters come first. This enables the <code class="literal">SecurityContextHolder</code> to be populated in time for use by the other filters. Examples are the use of SiteMesh to decorate your web pages or a web framework like Wicket which uses a filter to handle its requests.</p>

<p>As we saw earlier in the namespace chapter, it&#8217;s possible to use multiple <code class="literal">http</code> elements to define different security configurations for different URL patterns. Each element creates a filter chain within the internal <code class="literal">FilterChainProxy</code> and the URL pattern that should be mapped to it. The elements will be added in the order they are declared, so the most specific patterns must again be declared first. Here&#8217;s another example, for a similar situation to that above, where the application supports both a stateless RESTful API and also a normal web application which users log into using a form.</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><span class="hl-comment">&lt;!-- Stateless RESTful service using Basic authentication --&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;http</span> <span class="hl-attribute">pattern</span>=<span class="hl-value">"/restful/**"</span> <span class="hl-attribute">create-session</span>=<span class="hl-value">"stateless"</span><span class="hl-tag">&gt;</span>
<span class="hl-tag">&lt;intercept-url</span> <span class="hl-attribute">pattern</span>=<span class="hl-value">'/**'</span> <span class="hl-attribute">access</span>=<span class="hl-value">"hasRole('REMOTE')"</span><span class="hl-tag"> /&gt;</span>

<span class="hl-tag">&lt;/http&gt;</span>

<span class="hl-comment">&lt;!-- Empty filter chain for the login page --&gt;</span>
