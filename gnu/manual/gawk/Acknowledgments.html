<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>The initial draft of <cite>The GAWK Manual</cite> had the following acknowledgments:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people need to be thanked for their assistance in producing this
manual.  Jay Fenlason contributed many ideas and sample programs.  Richard
Mlynarik and Robert Chassell gave helpful comments on drafts of this
manual.  The paper <cite>A Supplemental Document for AWK</cite> by John W.
Pierce of the Chemistry Department at UC San Diego, pinpointed several
issues relevant both to <code>awk</code> implementation and to this manual, that
would otherwise have escaped us.
</p></blockquote>

<a name="index-Stallman_002c-Richard-1"></a>
<p>I would like to acknowledge Richard M. Stallman, for his vision of a
better world and for his courage in founding the FSF and starting the
GNU Project.

<a name="index-Chassell_002c-Robert-J_002e"></a>
<p>Robert J. Chassell provided much valuable advice on
the use of Texinfo.
He also deserves special thanks for
convincing me <em>not</em> to title this Web page
<cite>How to Gawk Politely</cite>.
Karl Berry helped significantly with the TeX part of Texinfo.

<a name="index-Schreiber_002c-Bert"></a>
<a name="index-Schreiber_002c-Rita"></a>
<p>I would like to thank Marshall and Elaine Hartholz of Seattle and
Dr. Bert and Rita Schreiber of Detroit for large amounts of quiet vacation
time in their homes, which allowed me to make significant progress on
this Web page and on <code>gawk</code> itself.
</p>
<a name="index-Hughes_002c-Phil"></a>
<p>Phil Hughes of SSC
contributed in a very important way by loaning me his laptop GNU/Linux
system, not once, but twice, which allowed me to do a lot of work while
away from home.
</p>
<a name="index-Trueman_002c-David-1"></a>
<p>David Trueman deserves special credit; he has done a yeoman job
of evolving <code>gawk</code> so that it performs well and without bugs.
Although he is no longer involved with <code>gawk</code>,
working with him on this project was a significant pleasure.

<a name="index-Drepper_002c-Ulrich"></a>
<a name="index-GNITS-mailing-list"></a>
<a name="index-mailing-list_002c-GNITS"></a>
<p>The intrepid members of the GNITS mailing list, and most notably Ulrich
Drepper, provided invaluable help and feedback for the design of the
internationalization features.
</p>
<p>Chuck Toporek, Mary Sheehan, and Claire Cloutier of O&rsquo;Reilly &amp; Associates contributed
significant editorial help for this Web page for the
3.1 release of <code>gawk</code>.

(in alphabetical order)
make up the current <code>gawk</code> &ldquo;crack portability team.&rdquo;  Without
their hard work and help, <code>gawk</code> would not be nearly the robust,
portable program it is today.  It has been and continues to be a pleasure
working with this team of fine people.
</p>
<p>Notable code and documentation contributions were made by
a number of people. See section <a href="Contributors.html#Contributors">Major Contributors to <code>gawk</code></a> for the full list.
</p>

<p>Thanks to Michael Brennan for the Forewords.
</p>
<a name="index-Duman_002c-Patrice"></a>
<a name="index-Berry_002c-Karl-1"></a>
<p>Thanks to Patrice Dumas for the new <code>makeinfo</code> program.
Thanks to Karl Berry, who continues to work to keep
the Texinfo markup language sane.
</p>
<a name="index-Kernighan_002c-Brian-2"></a>
<a name="index-Brennan_002c-Michael-2"></a>
<a name="index-Day_002c-Robert-P_002eJ_002e"></a>
<p>Robert P.J. Day, Michael Brennan, and Brian Kernighan kindly acted as
reviewers for the 2015 edition of this Web page. Their feedback
helped improve the final work.
</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Brian Kernighan for his invaluable assistance during the
testing and debugging of <code>gawk</code>, and for his ongoing
help and advice in clarifying numerous points about the language.
We could not have done nearly as good a job on either <code>gawk</code>
or its documentation without his help.
</p>
<p>Brian is in a class by himself as a programmer and technical
author.  I have to thank him (yet again) for his ongoing friendship
and for being a role model to me for close to 30 years!
Having him as a reviewer is an exciting privilege. It has also
been extremely humbling<small class="enddots">...</small>

<p>I must thank my wonderful wife, Miriam, for her patience through
the many versions of this project, for her proofreading,
and for sharing me with the computer.
I would like to thank my parents for their love, and for the grace with
which they raised and educated me.
Finally, I also must acknowledge my gratitude to G-d, for the many opportunities
He has sent my way, as well as for the gifts He has given me with which to
take advantage of those opportunities.
