<span id="Memory_002dmapped-I_002fO-1"></span><h3 class="section">13.8 Memory-mapped I/O</h3>

<p>On modern operating systems, it is possible to <em>mmap</em> (pronounced
&ldquo;em-map&rdquo;) a file to a region of memory.  When this is done, the file can
be accessed just like an array in the program.
</p>
<p>This is more efficient than <code>read</code> or <code>write</code>, as only the regions
of the file that a program actually accesses are loaded.  Accesses to
not-yet-loaded parts of the mmapped region are handled in the same way as
swapped out pages.
</p>
<p>Since mmapped pages can be stored back to their file when physical
memory is low, it is possible to mmap files orders of magnitude larger
than both the physical memory <em>and</em> swap space.  The only limit is
address space.  The theoretical limit is 4GB on a 32-bit machine -
however, the actual limit will be smaller since some areas will be
reserved for other purposes.  If the LFS interface is used the file size
on 32-bit systems is not limited to 2GB (offsets are signed which
reduces the addressable area of 4GB by half); the full 64-bit are
available.
</p>
<p>Memory mapping only works on entire pages of memory.  Thus, addresses
for mapping must be page-aligned, and length values will be rounded up.
To determine the default size of a page the machine uses one should use:
</p>
<span id="index-_005fSC_005fPAGESIZE"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">size_t page_size = (size_t) sysconf (_SC_PAGESIZE);
</pre></div>

<p>On some systems, mappings can use larger page sizes
for certain files, and applications can request larger page sizes for
anonymous mappings as well (see the <code>MAP_HUGETLB</code> flag below).
</p>
<p>The following functions are declared in <samp>sys/mman.h</samp>:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-mmap">Function: <em>void *</em> <strong>mmap</strong> <em>(void *<var>address</var>, size_t <var>length</var>, int <var>protect</var>, int <var>flags</var>, int <var>filedes</var>, off_t <var>offset</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:

| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>


<p>The <code>mmap</code> function creates a new mapping, connected to bytes
(<var>offset</var>) to (<var>offset</var> + <var>length</var> - 1) in the file open on
<var>filedes</var>.  A new reference for the file specified by <var>filedes</var>
is created, which is not removed by closing the file.
</p>
<p><var>address</var> gives a preferred starting address for the mapping.
<code>NULL</code> expresses no preference.  Any previous mapping at that
address is automatically removed.  The address you give may still be
changed, unless you use the <code>MAP_FIXED</code> flag.
</p>
<p><var>protect</var> contains flags that control what kind of access is
permitted.  They include <code>PROT_READ</code>, <code>PROT_WRITE</code>, and
<code>PROT_EXEC</code>.  The special flag <code>PROT_NONE</code> reserves a region
of address space for future use.  The <code>mprotect</code> function can be
used to change the protection flags.  See <a href="Memory-Protection.html#Memory-Protection">Memory Protection</a>.
</p>
<p><var>flags</var> contains flags that control the nature of the map.
One of <code>MAP_SHARED</code> or <code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> must be specified.
</p>
<p>They include:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>MAP_PRIVATE</code>
<span id="index-MAP_005fPRIVATE"></span>
</dt>
<dd><p>This specifies that writes to the region should never be written back
to the attached file.  Instead, a copy is made for the process, and the
region will be swapped normally if memory runs low.  No other process will
see the changes.
</p>
<p>Since private mappings effectively revert to ordinary memory
when written to, you must have enough virtual memory for a copy of
the entire mmapped region if you use this mode with <code>PROT_WRITE</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>MAP_SHARED</code>
<span id="index-MAP_005fSHARED"></span>
</dt>
<dd><p>This specifies that writes to the region will be written back to the
file.  Changes made will be shared immediately with other processes
mmaping the same file.
</p>
<p>Note that actual writing may take place at any time.  You need to use
<code>msync</code>, described below, if it is important that other processes
using conventional I/O get a consistent view of the file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>MAP_FIXED</code>
<span id="index-MAP_005fFIXED"></span>
</dt>
<dd><p>This forces the system to use the exact mapping address specified in
<var>address</var> and fail if it can&rsquo;t.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>MAP_ANONYMOUS</code>
<span id="index-MAP_005fANONYMOUS"></span>
</dt>
<dt><code>MAP_ANON</code>
<span id="index-MAP_005fANON"></span>
</dt>
<dd><p>This flag tells the system to create an anonymous mapping, not connected
to a file.  <var>filedes</var> and <var>offset</var> are ignored, and the region is
initialized with zeros.
</p>
<p>Anonymous maps are used as the basic primitive to extend the heap on some
systems.  They are also useful to share data between multiple tasks
without creating a file.
</p>
<p>On some systems using private anonymous mmaps is more efficient than using
<code>malloc</code> for large blocks.  This is not an issue with the GNU C Library,
as the included <code>malloc</code> automatically uses <code>mmap</code> where appropriate.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>MAP_HUGETLB</code>
<span id="index-MAP_005fHUGETLB"></span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This requests that the system uses an alternative page size which is
larger than the default page size for the mapping.  For some workloads,
increasing the page size for large mappings improves performance because
the system needs to handle far fewer pages.  For other workloads which
require frequent transfer of pages between storage or different nodes,
the decreased page granularity may cause performance problems due to the
increased page size and larger transfers.
</p>
<p>In order to create the mapping, the system needs physically contiguous
memory of the size of the increased page size.  As a result,
<code>MAP_HUGETLB</code> mappings are affected by memory fragmentation, and
their creation can fail even if plenty of memory is available in the
system.
</p>
<p>Not all file systems support mappings with an increased page size.
</p>
<p>The <code>MAP_HUGETLB</code> flag is specific to Linux.
</p>


</dd>
</dl>

<p><code>mmap</code> returns the address of the new mapping, or
<code>MAP_FAILED</code> for an error.

<p>Possible errors include:

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>EINVAL</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Either <var>address</var> was unusable (because it is not a multiple of the
applicable page size), or inconsistent <var>flags</var> were given.

<p>If <code>MAP_HUGETLB</code> was specified, the file or system does not support
large page sizes.

</p>

<p>The <code>mmap64</code> function is equivalent to the <code>mmap</code> function but
the <var>offset</var> parameter is of type <code>off64_t</code>.  On 32-bit systems
this allows the file associated with the <var>filedes</var> descriptor to be
larger than 2GB.  <var>filedes</var> must be a descriptor returned from a
call to <code>open64</code> or <code>fopen64</code> and <code>freopen64</code> where the
descriptor is retrieved with <code>fileno</code>.
</p>
<p>When the sources are translated with <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> this

replaces the old API.

<p><code>munmap</code> removes any memory maps from (<var>addr</var>) to (<var>addr</var> +
<var>length</var>).  <var>length</var> should be the length of the mapping.
</p>
<p>It is safe to unmap multiple mappings in one command, or include unmapped
space in the range.  It is also possible to unmap only part of an existing
mapping.  However, only entire pages can be removed.  If <var>length</var> is not
an even number of pages, it will be rounded up.
</p>
<p>It returns <em>0</em> for success and <em>-1</em> for an error.
</p>
<p>One error is possible:

<p>When using shared mappings, the kernel can write the file at any time
before the mapping is removed.  To be certain data has actually been
written to the file and will be accessible to non-memory-mapped I/O, it
is necessary to use this function.
</p>
<p>It operates on the region <var>address</var> to (<var>address</var> + <var>length</var>).
It may be used on part of a mapping or multiple mappings, however the
region given should not contain any unmapped space.
</p>
<p><var>flags</var> can contain some options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>MS_SYNC</code>
<span id="index-MS_005fSYNC"></span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This flag makes sure the data is actually written <em>to disk</em>.
Normally <code>msync</code> only makes sure that accesses to a file with
conventional I/O reflect the recent changes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>MS_ASYNC</code>
<span id="index-MS_005fASYNC"></span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This tells <code>msync</code> to begin the synchronization, but not to wait for
it to complete.
</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p><code>msync</code> returns <em>0</em> for success and <em>-1</em> for
error.  Errors include:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<p>This function can be used to change the size of an existing memory
area. <var>address</var> and <var>length</var> must cover a region entirely mapped
in the same <code>mmap</code> statement.  A new mapping with the same
characteristics will be returned with the length <var>new_length</var>.
</p>
<p>One option is possible, <code>MREMAP_MAYMOVE</code>.  If it is given in
<var>flags</var>, the system may remove the existing mapping and create a new
one of the desired length in another location.
</p>
<p>The address of the resulting mapping is returned, or <em>-1</em>.  Possible
error codes include:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>EFAULT</code></dt>
<dd><p>There is no existing mapping in at least part of the original region, or
the region covers two or more distinct mappings.

<dt><code>EINVAL</code></dt>
<dd><p>The address given is misaligned or inappropriate.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EAGAIN</code></dt>
<dd><p>The region has pages locked, and if extended it would exceed the
process&rsquo;s resource limit for locked pages.  See <a href="Limits-on-Resources.html#Limits-on-Resources">Limits on Resources</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ENOMEM</code></dt>
<dd><p>The region is private writable, and insufficient virtual memory is
available to extend it.  Also, this error will occur if
<code>MREMAP_MAYMOVE</code> is not given and the extension would collide with
another mapped region.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl>

<p>This function is only available on a few systems.  Except for performing
optional optimizations one should not rely on this function.
</p>
<p>Not all file descriptors may be mapped.  Sockets, pipes, and most devices
only allow sequential access and do not fit into the mapping abstraction.
In addition, some regular files may not be mmapable, and older kernels may
not support mapping at all.  Thus, programs using <code>mmap</code> should
have a fallback method to use should it fail. See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Mmap.html#Mmap">Mmap</a> in <cite>GNU
Coding Standards</cite>.

<p>The <code>memfd_create</code> function returns a file descriptor which can be
used to create memory mappings using the <code>mmap</code> function.  It is
similar to the <code>shm_open</code> function in the sense that these mappings
are not backed by actual files.  However, the descriptor returned by
<code>memfd_create</code> does not correspond to a named object; the
<var>name</var> argument is used for debugging purposes only (e.g., will
appear in <samp>/proc</samp>), and separate invocations of <code>memfd_create</code>
with the same <var>name</var> will not return descriptors for the same region
of memory.  The descriptor can also be used to create alias mappings
within the same process.
</p>
<p>The descriptor initially refers to a zero-length file.  Before mappings
can be created which are backed by memory, the file size needs to be
increased with the <code>ftruncate</code> function.  See <a href="File-Size.html#File-Size">File Size</a>.
</p>
<p>The <var>flags</var> argument can be a combination of the following flags:
