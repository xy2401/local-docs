<p>Cryptographic applications often need some random data that will be as
difficult as possible for a hostile eavesdropper to guess.  For
instance, encryption keys should be chosen at random, and the &ldquo;salt&rdquo;
strings used by <code>crypt</code> (see <a href="Passphrase-Storage.html#Passphrase-Storage">Passphrase Storage</a>) should also
be chosen at random.
</p>
<p>Some pseudo-random number generators do not provide unpredictable-enough
output for cryptographic applications; see <a href="Pseudo_002dRandom-Numbers.html#Pseudo_002dRandom-Numbers">Pseudo-Random Numbers</a>.
Such applications need to use a <em>cryptographic random number
generator</em> (CRNG), also sometimes called a <em>cryptographically strong
pseudo-random number generator</em> (CSPRNG) or <em>deterministic random
bit generator</em> (DRBG).
</p>
<p>Currently, the GNU C Library does not provide a cryptographic random number
generator, but it does provide functions that read random data from a
<em>randomness source</em> supplied by the operating system.  The
randomness source is a CRNG at heart, but it also continually
&ldquo;re-seeds&rdquo; itself from physical sources of randomness, such as
electronic noise and clock jitter.  This means applications do not need
to do anything to ensure that the random numbers it produces are
different on each run.
</p>
<p>The catch, however, is that these functions will only produce
relatively short random strings in any one call.  Often this is not a
problem, but applications that need more than a few kilobytes of
cryptographically strong random data should call these functions once
and use their output to seed a CRNG.
</p>
<p>Most applications should use <code>getentropy</code>.  The <code>getrandom</code>
function is intended for low-level applications which need additional
control over blocking behavior.

<p>This function writes exactly <var>length</var> bytes of random data to the
array starting at <var>buffer</var>.  <var>length</var> can be no more than 256.
On success, it returns zero.  On failure, it returns <em>-1</em>, and
<code>errno</code> is set to indicate the problem.  Some of the possible
errors are listed below.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>ENOSYS</code></dt>
<dd><p>The operating system does not implement a randomness source, or does
not support this way of accessing it.  (For instance, the system call
used by this function was added to the Linux kernel in version 3.17.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EFAULT</code></dt>
<dd><p>The combination of <var>buffer</var> and <var>length</var> arguments specifies

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EIO</code></dt>
<dd><p><var>length</var> is larger than 256, or the kernel entropy pool has
suffered a catastrophic failure.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>A call to <code>getentropy</code> can only block when the system has just
booted and the randomness source has not yet been initialized.
However, if it does block, it cannot be interrupted by signals or
thread cancellation.  Programs intended to run in very early stages of
the boot process may need to use <code>getrandom</code> in non-blocking mode
instead, and be prepared to cope with random data not being available
at all.
</p>
<p>The <code>getentropy</code> function is declared in the header file
<samp>sys/random.h</samp>.  It is derived from OpenBSD.

<p>This function writes up to <var>length</var> bytes of random data to the
array starting at <var>buffer</var>.  The <var>flags</var> argument should be
either zero, or the bitwise OR of some of the following flags:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>GRND_RANDOM</code></dt>
<dd><p>Use the <samp>/dev/random</samp> (blocking) source instead of the
<samp>/dev/urandom</samp> (non-blocking) source to obtain randomness.
</p>
<p>If this flag is specified, the call may block, potentially for quite
some time, even after the randomness source has been initialized.  If it
is not specified, the call can only block when the system has just
booted and the randomness source has not yet been initialized.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>GRND_NONBLOCK</code></dt>
<dd><p>Instead of blocking, return to the caller immediately if no data is
available.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Unlike <code>getentropy</code>, the <code>getrandom</code> function is a
cancellation point, and if it blocks, it can be interrupted by
signals.
</p>
<p>On success, <code>getrandom</code> returns the number of bytes which have
been written to the buffer, which may be less than <var>length</var>.  On
error, it returns <em>-1</em>, and <code>errno</code> is set to indicate the
problem.  Some of the possible errors are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>ENOSYS</code></dt>
<dd><p>The operating system does not implement a randomness source, or does
not support this way of accessing it.  (For instance, the system call
used by this function was added to the Linux kernel in version 3.17.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EAGAIN</code></dt>
<dd><p>No random data was available and <code>GRND_NONBLOCK</code> was specified in
<var>flags</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EFAULT</code></dt>
<dd><p>The combination of <var>buffer</var> and <var>length</var> arguments specifies
an invalid memory range.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EINTR</code></dt>
<dd><p>The system call was interrupted.  During the system boot process, before
the kernel randomness pool is initialized, this can happen even if
<var>flags</var> is zero.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EINVAL</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <var>flags</var> argument contains an invalid combination of flags.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The <code>getrandom</code> function is declared in the header file
<samp>sys/random.h</samp>.  It is a GNU extension.
