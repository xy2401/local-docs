<dt>Amazing <code>awk</code> Assembler</dt>
<dd><p>Henry Spencer at the University of Toronto wrote a retargetable assembler
completely as <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> scripts.  It is thousands
of lines long, including machine descriptions for several eight-bit
microcomputers.  It is a good example of a program that would have been
better written in another language.

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Argument</dt>
<dd><p>An argument can be two different things.  It can be an option or a
file name passed to a command while invoking it from the command line, or
it can be something passed to a <em>function</em> inside a program, e.g.
inside <code>awk</code>.
</p>
<p>In the latter case, an argument can be passed to a function in two ways.
Either it is given to the called function by value, i.e., a copy of the
value of the variable is made available to the called function, but the
original variable cannot be modified by the function itself; or it is
given by reference, i.e., a pointer to the interested variable is passed to
the function, which can then directly modify it. In <code>awk</code>
scalars are passed by value, and arrays are passed by reference.
See &ldquo;Pass By Value/Reference.&rdquo;
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Array</dt>
<dd><p>A grouping of multiple values under the same name.
Most languages just provide sequential arrays.
<code>awk</code> provides associative arrays.

<dd><p>A statement in a program that a condition is true at this point in the program.
Useful for reasoning about how a program is supposed to behave.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Assignment</dt>
<dd><p>An <code>awk</code> expression that changes the value of some <code>awk</code>
variable or data object.  An object that you can assign to is called an
<em>lvalue</em>.  The assigned values are called <em>rvalues</em>.
See section <a href="Assignment-Ops.html#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Expressions</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Associative Array</dt>
<dd><p>Arrays in which the indices may be numbers or strings, not just
sequential integers in a fixed range.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>awk</code> Language</dt>
<dd><p>The language in which <code>awk</code> programs are written.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>awk</code> Program</dt>
<dd><p>An <code>awk</code> program consists of a series of <em>patterns</em> and
<em>actions</em>, collectively known as <em>rules</em>.  For each input record
given to the program, the program&rsquo;s rules are all processed in turn.
<code>awk</code> programs may also contain function definitions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>awk</code> Script</dt>
<dd><p>Another name for an <code>awk</code> program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bash</dt>
<dd><p>The GNU version of the standard shell
(the <b>B</b>ourne-<b>A</b>gain <b>SH</b>ell).
See also &ldquo;Bourne Shell.&rdquo;
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Binary</dt>
<dd><p>Base-two notation, where the digits are <code>0</code>&ndash;<code>1</code>. Since
electronic circuitry works &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; in base 2 (just think of Off/On),
everything inside a computer is calculated using base 2. Each digit
represents the presence (or absence) of a power of 2 and is called a
<em>bit</em>. So, for example, the base-two number <code>10101</code> is
the same as decimal 21, ((1 x 16) + (1 x 4) + (1 x 1)).
</p>
<p>Since base-two numbers quickly become
very long to read and write, they are usually grouped by 3 (i.e., they are
read as octal numbers), or by 4 (i.e., they are read as hexadecimal
numbers). There is no direct way to insert base 2 numbers in a C program.
If need arises, such numbers are usually inserted as octal or hexadecimal
numbers. The number of base-two digits that fit into registers used for
representing integer numbers in computers is a rough indication of the
computing power of the computer itself.  Most computers nowadays use 64
bits for representing integer numbers in their registers, but 32-bit,
16-bit and 8-bit registers have been widely used in the past.
See section <a href="Nondecimal_002dnumbers.html#Nondecimal_002dnumbers">Octal and Hexadecimal Numbers</a>.
</p></dd>
<dt>Bit</dt>
<dd><p>Short for &ldquo;Binary Digit.&rdquo;
All values in computer memory ultimately reduce to binary digits: values
that are either zero or one.
Groups of bits may be interpreted differently&mdash;as integers,
floating-point numbers, character data, addresses of other
memory objects, or other data.
<code>awk</code> lets you work with floating-point numbers and strings.
<code>gawk</code> lets you manipulate bit values with the built-in
functions described in
<a href="Bitwise-Functions.html#Bitwise-Functions">Bit-Manipulation Functions</a>.
</p>
<p>Computers are often defined by how many bits they use to represent integer
values.  Typical systems are 32-bit systems, but 64-bit systems are
becoming increasingly popular, and 16-bit systems have essentially
disappeared.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Boolean Expression</dt>
<dd><p>Named after the English mathematician Boole. See also &ldquo;Logical Expression.&rdquo;
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bourne Shell</dt>
<dd><p>The standard shell (<samp>/bin/sh</samp>) on Unix and Unix-like systems,
originally written by Steven R. Bourne at Bell Laboratories.
Many shells (Bash, <code>ksh</code>, <code>pdksh</code>, <code>zsh</code>) are
generally upwardly compatible with the Bourne shell.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Braces</dt>
<dd><p>The characters &lsquo;<samp>{</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>}</samp>&rsquo;.  Braces are used in
<code>awk</code> for delimiting actions, compound statements, and function
bodies.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bracket Expression</dt>
<dd><p>Inside a <em>regular expression</em>, an expression included in square
brackets, meant to designate a single character as belonging to a
specified character class. A bracket expression can contain a list of one
or more characters, like &lsquo;<samp>[abc]</samp>&rsquo;, a range of characters, like
&lsquo;<samp>[A-Z]</samp>&rsquo;, or a name, delimited by &lsquo;<samp>:</samp>&rsquo;, that designates a known set
of characters, like &lsquo;<samp>[:digit:]</samp>&rsquo;. The form of bracket expression
enclosed between &lsquo;<samp>:</samp>&rsquo; is independent of the underlying representation
of the character themselves, which could utilize the ASCII, EBCDIC, or
Unicode codesets, depending on the architecture of the computer system, and on
localization.
See also &ldquo;Regular Expression.&rdquo;
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Built-in Function</dt>
<dd><p>The <code>awk</code> language provides built-in functions that perform various
numerical, I/O-related, and string computations.  Examples are
<code>sqrt()</code> (for the square root of a number) and <code>substr()</code> (for a
substring of a string).
<code>gawk</code> provides functions for timestamp management, bit manipulation,
array sorting, type checking,
and runtime string translation.
(See section <a href="Built_002din.html#Built_002din">Built-in Functions</a>.)

<dt>C</dt>
<dd><p>The system programming language that most GNU software is written in.  The
<code>awk</code> programming language has C-like syntax, and this Web page
points out similarities between <code>awk</code> and C when appropriate.
</p>
<p>In general, <code>gawk</code> attempts to be as similar to the 1990 version
of ISO C as makes sense.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>C Shell</dt>
<dd><p>The C Shell (<code>csh</code> or its improved version, <code>tcsh</code>) is a Unix shell that was
created by Bill Joy in the late 1970s. The C shell was differentiated from
other shells by its interactive features and overall style, which
looks more like C. The C Shell is not backward compatible with the Bourne
Shell, so special attention is required when converting scripts
written for other Unix shells to the C shell, especially with regard to the management of
shell variables.

<dd><p>An expression using the &lsquo;<samp>?:</samp>&rsquo; ternary operator, such as
&lsquo;<samp><var>expr1</var> ? <var>expr2</var> : <var>expr3</var></samp>&rsquo;.  The expression
<var>expr1</var> is evaluated; if the result is true, the value of the whole

</dd>
<dt>Field</dt>
<dd><p>When <code>awk</code> reads an input record, it splits the record into pieces
separated by whitespace (or by a separator regexp that you can
change by setting the predefined variable <code>FS</code>).  Such pieces are
called fields.  If the pieces are of fixed length, you can use the built-in
variable <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code> to describe their lengths.
If you wish to specify the contents of fields instead of the field
separator, you can use the predefined variable <code>FPAT</code> to do so.

<dt>Function</dt>
<dd><p>A part of an <code>awk</code> program that can be invoked from every point of
the program, to perform a task.  <code>awk</code> has several built-in
functions.
Users can define their own functions in every part of the program.
Function can be recursive, i.e., they may invoke themselves.
See section <a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions</a>.
In <code>gawk</code> it is also possible to have functions shared
among different programs, and included where required using the
<code>@include</code> directive
(see section <a href="Include-Files.html#Include-Files">Including Other Files into Your Program</a>).

<dt>Reference Counts</dt>
<dd><p>An internal mechanism in <code>gawk</code> to minimize the amount of memory
needed to store the value of string variables. If the value assumed by
a variable is used in more than one place, only one copy of the value
itself is kept, and the associated reference count is increased when the
same value is used by an additional variable, and decreased when the related
variable is no longer in use. When the reference count goes to zero,
the memory space used to store the value of the variable is freed.

<dt>Regexp</dt>
<dd><p>See &ldquo;Regular Expression.&rdquo;
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Regular Expression</dt>
<dd><p>A regular expression (&ldquo;regexp&rdquo; for short) is a pattern that denotes a
set of strings, possibly an infinite set.  For example, the regular expression
&lsquo;<samp>R.*xp</samp>&rsquo; matches any string starting with the letter &lsquo;<samp>R</samp>&rsquo;
and ending with the letters &lsquo;<samp>xp</samp>&rsquo;.  In <code>awk</code>, regular expressions are
used in patterns and in conditional expressions.  Regular expressions may contain
escape sequences. (See section <a href="Regexp.html#Regexp">Regular Expressions</a>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Regular Expression Constant</dt>
<dd><p>A regular expression constant is a regular expression written within
slashes, such as <code>/foo/</code>.  This regular expression is chosen
when you write the <code>awk</code> program and cannot be changed during
its execution. (See section <a href="Regexp-Usage.html#Regexp-Usage">How to Use Regular Expressions</a>.)

More than one way of rounding exists, and in <code>gawk</code>
it is possible to choose which method should be used in a program.
See section <a href="Setting-the-rounding-mode.html#Setting-the-rounding-mode">Setting the Rounding Mode</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rule</dt>
<dd><p>A segment of an <code>awk</code> program that specifies how to process single
input records.  A rule consists of a <em>pattern</em> and an <em>action</em>.
<code>awk</code> reads an input record; then, for each rule, if the input record
satisfies the rule&rsquo;s pattern, <code>awk</code> executes the rule&rsquo;s action.
Otherwise, the rule does nothing for that input record.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rvalue</dt>
<dd><p>A value that can appear on the right side of an assignment operator.
In <code>awk</code>, essentially every expression has a value. These values
are rvalues.

</dd>
<dt>Short-Circuit</dt>
<dd><p>The nature of the <code>awk</code> logical operators &lsquo;<samp>&amp;&amp;</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>||</samp>&rsquo;.
If the value of the entire expression is determinable from evaluating just
the lefthand side of these operators, the righthand side is not
evaluated.
(See section <a href="Boolean-Ops.html#Boolean-Ops">Boolean Expressions</a>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Side Effect</dt>
<dd><p>A side effect occurs when an expression has an effect aside from merely
producing a value.  Assignment expressions, increment and decrement
expressions, and function calls have side effects.
(See section <a href="Assignment-Ops.html#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Expressions</a>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Single Precision</dt>
<dd><p>An internal representation of numbers that can have fractional parts.
Single precision numbers keep track of fewer digits than do double precision
numbers, but operations on them are sometimes less expensive in terms of CPU time.
This is the type used by some ancient versions of <code>awk</code> to store
numeric values.  It is the C type <code>float</code>.

</p>
</dd>
<dt>Statement</dt>
<dd><p>An expression inside an <code>awk</code> program in the action part
of a pattern&ndash;action rule, or inside an
<code>awk</code> function. A statement can be a variable assignment,
an array operation, a loop, etc.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Stream Editor</dt>
<dd><p>A program that reads records from an input stream and processes them one
or more at a time.  This is in contrast with batch programs, which may
expect to read their input files in entirety before starting to do
anything, as well as with interactive programs which require input from the
user.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>String</dt>
<dd><p>A datum consisting of a sequence of characters, such as &lsquo;<samp>I am a
