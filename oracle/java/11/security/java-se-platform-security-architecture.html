               <div>
                  <p>Since the inception of Java technology, there has been strong and growing interest around the security of the Java platform as well as new security issues raised by the deployment of Java technology. </p>
                  <p>From a technology provider's point of view, Java security includes two aspects:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>Provide the Java platform as a secure, ready-built platform on which to run Java-enabled applications in a secure fashion.</li>
                     <li>Provide security tools and services implemented in the Java programming language that enable a wider range of security-sensitive applications, for example, in the enterprise world.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This document discusses issues related to the first aspect, where the customers for such technologies include vendors that bundle or embed Java technology in their products (such as browsers and operating systems).</p>
               </div>
               <div class="sect3"><a id="GUID-CF079719-BCCD-44B5-B637-288D0D28D4F0" name="GUID-CF079719-BCCD-44B5-B637-288D0D28D4F0"></a><h4 id="JSSEC-GUID-CF079719-BCCD-44B5-B637-288D0D28D4F0" class="sect4">The Original Sandbox Model</h4>
                  <div>
                     <p>The original security model provided by the Java platform is known as the sandbox model, which existed in order to provide a very restricted environment in which to run untrusted code obtained from the open network. The essence of the sandbox model is that local code is trusted to have full access to vital system resources (such as the file system) while downloaded remote code (an applet) is not trusted and can access only the limited resources provided inside the sandbox. This sandbox model is illustrated in the figure below. </p>
                     <p><span><img src="img/jssec_dt_030_anc4.png" alt="Description of jssec_dt_030_anc4.eps follows" title="Description of jssec_dt_030_anc4.eps follows" longdesc="img_text/jssec_dt_030_anc4.html"><br><a href="img_text/jssec_dt_030_anc4.html">Description of the illustration jssec_dt_030_anc4.eps</a></span></p>
                     <p> The sandbox model was deployed through the Java Development Kit (JDK), and was generally adopted by applications built with JDK 1.0, including Java-enabled web browsers.</p>
                     <p> Overall security is enforced through a number of mechanisms. First of all, the language is designed to be type-safe and easy to use. The hope is that the burden on the programmer is such that the likelihood of making subtle mistakes is lessened compared with using other programming languages such as C or C++. Language features such as automatic memory management, garbage collection, and range checking on strings and arrays are examples of how the language helps the programmer to write safe code.</p>
                     <p> Second, compilers and a bytecode verifier ensure that only legitimate Java bytecodes are executed. The bytecode verifier, together with the Java Virtual Machine, guarantees language safety at run time.</p>
                     <p> Moreover, a classloader defines a local name space, which can be used to ensure that an untrusted applet cannot interfere with the running of other programs.</p>
                     <p> Finally, access to crucial system resources is mediated by the Java Virtual Machine and is checked in advance by a <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> class that restricts the actions of a piece of untrusted code to the bare minimum.
                     </p>
                     <p> JDK 1.1 introduced the concept of a "signed applet", as illustrated by the figure below. In that release, a correctly digitally signed applet is treated as if it is trusted local code if the signature key is recognized as trusted by the end system that receives the applet. Signed applets, together with their signatures, are delivered in the JAR (Java Archive) format. In JDK 1.1, unsigned applets still run in the sandbox.</p>

                  <div>
                     <p> The new Java SE Platform Security Architecture, illustrated in the figure below, is introduced primarily for the following purposes. </p><img src="img/jssec_dt_032_anc9.png" alt="Description of jssec_dt_032_anc9.eps follows" title="Description of jssec_dt_032_anc9.eps follows" longdesc="img_text/jssec_dt_032_anc9.html"><br><a href="img_text/jssec_dt_032_anc9.html">Description of the illustration jssec_dt_032_anc9.eps</a><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li> 
                           <p>Fine-grained access control.</p>
                           <p>This capability existed in the JDK from the beginning, but to use it, the application writer had to do substantial programming (e.g., by subclassing and customizing the <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> and <span class="apiname">ClassLoader</span> classes). The HotJava browser 1.0 is such an application, as it allows the browser user to choose from a small number of different security levels. 
                           </p>
                           <p>However, such programming is extremely security-sensitive and requires sophisticated skills and in-depth knowledge of computer security. The new architecture will make this exercise simpler and safer.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                           <p>Easily configurable security policy.</p>
                           <p>Once again, this capability existed previously in the JDK but was not easy to use. Moreover, writing security code is not straightforward, so it is desirable to allow application builders and users to configure security policies without having to program. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                           <p>Easily extensible access control structure.</p>
                           <p>Up to JDK 1.1, in order to create a new access permission, you had to add a new <code class="codeph">check</code> method to the <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> class. The new architecture allows typed permissions (each representing an access to a system resource) and automatic handling of all permissions (including yet-to-be-defined permissions) of the correct type. No new method in the <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> class needs to be created in most cases. (In fact, we have so far not encountered a situation where a new method must be created.) 
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                           <p>Extension of security checks to all Java programs, including applications as well as applets.</p>
                           <p>There is no longer a built-in concept that all local code is trusted. Instead, local code (e.g., non-system code, application packages installed on the local file system) is subjected to the same security control as applets, although it is possible, if desired, to declare that the policy on local code (or remote code) be the most liberal, thus enabling such code to effectively run as totally trusted. The same principle applies to signed applets and any Java application. </p>
                           <p> Finally, an implicit goal is to make internal adjustment to the design of security classes (including the <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> and <span class="apiname">ClassLoader</span> classes) to reduce the risks of creating subtle security holes in future programming.

               <div>
                  <p>We now go over, in some detail, the new protection architecture and give a brief explanation of its functionality. We start with an overview of the basic concepts behind the new architecture. We then introduce the major new classes in a natural order, starting with permission specifications, going on to the policy and related features, followed by access control and its usage, and then covering secure class loading and resolution. </p>
                  <p>A fundamental concept and important building block of system security is the protection domain [Saltzer and Schroeder 75]. A domain can be scoped by the set of objects that are currently directly accessible by a principal, where a principal is an entity in the computer system to which permissions (and as a result, accountability) are granted. The sandbox utilized in JDK 1.0 is one example of a protection domain with a fixed boundary.</p>
                  <p>The protection domain concept serves as a convenient mechanism for grouping and isolation between units of protection. For example, it is possible (but not yet provided as a built-in feature) to separate protection domains from interacting with each other so that any permitted interaction must be either through trusted system code or explicitly allowed by the domains concerned. Note that existing object accessibility rules remain valid under the new security architecture.</p>
                  <p>Protection domains generally fall into two distinct categories: system domain and application domain. It is important that all protected external resources, such as the file system, the networking facility, and the screen and keyboard, be accessible only via system domains. The figure below illustrates the domain composition of a Java application environment.</p><img src="img/jssec_dt_028_anc2.png" alt="Description of jssec_dt_028_anc2.eps follows" title="Description of jssec_dt_028_anc2.eps follows" longdesc="img_text/jssec_dt_028_anc2.html"><br><a href="img_text/jssec_dt_028_anc2.html">Description of the illustration jssec_dt_028_anc2.eps</a><p>A domain conceptually encloses a set of classes whose instances are granted the same set of permissions. Protection domains are determined by the policy currently in effect. The Java application environment maintains a mapping from code (classes and instances) to their protection domains and then to their permissions, as illustrated by the figure below.</p><img src="img/jssec_dt_026_anc.png" alt="Description of jssec_dt_026_anc.eps follows" title="Description of jssec_dt_026_anc.eps follows" longdesc="img_text/jssec_dt_026_anc.html"><br><a href="img_text/jssec_dt_026_anc.html">Description of the illustration jssec_dt_026_anc.eps</a><p>A thread of execution (which is often, but not necessarily tied to, a single Java thread, which in turn is not necessarily tied to the thread concept of the underlying operation system) may occur completely within a single protection domain or may involve an application domain and also the system domain. For example, an application that prints a message out will have to interact with the system domain that is the only access point to an output stream. In this case, it is crucial that at any time the application domain does not gain additional permissions by calling the system domain. Otherwise, there can be serious security implications.</p>
                  <p>In the reverse situation where a system domain invokes a method from an application domain, such as when the AWT system domain calls an applet's paint method to display the applet, it is again crucial that at any time the effective access rights are the same as current rights enabled in the application domain.</p>
                  <p>In other words, a less "powerful" domain cannot gain additional permissions as a result of calling or being called by a more powerful domain.</p>
                  <p>This discussion of one thread involving two protection domains naturally generalizes to a thread that traverses multiple protection domains. A simple and prudent rule of thumb for calculating permissions is the following:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>The permission set of an execution thread is considered to be the intersection of the permissions of all protection domains traversed by the execution thread.</li>
                     <li>When a piece of code calls the <span class="apiname">doPrivileged</span> method (see below), the permission set of the execution thread is considered to include a permission if it is allowed by the said code's protection domain and by all protection domains that are called or entered directly or indirectly subsequently.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>As you can see, the <span class="apiname">doPrivileged</span> method enables a piece of trusted code to temporarily enable access to more resources than are available directly to the application that called it. This is necessary in some situations. For example, an application may not be allowed direct access to files that contain fonts, but the system utility to display a document must obtain those fonts, on behalf of the user. We provide the <span class="apiname">doPrivileged</span> method for the system domain to deal with this situation, and the method is in fact available to all domains. 
                  </p>
                  <p>During execution, when access to a critical system resource (such as file I/O and network I/O) is requested, the resource-handling code directly or indirectly invokes a special <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> class method that evaluates the request and decides if the request should be granted or denied.
                  </p>
                  <p>Such an evaluation follows and generalizes the "rule of thumb" given above. The actual way in which the evaluation is conducted can vary between implementations. The basic principle is to examine the call history and the permissions granted to the relevant protection domains, and to return silently if the request is granted or throw a security exception if the request is denied.</p>
                  <p>Finally, each domain (system or application) may also implement additional protection of its internal resources within its own domain boundary. For example, a banking application may need to support and protect internal concepts such as checking accounts, deposits and withdrawals. Because the semantics of such protection is unlikely to be predictable or enforceable by the JDK, the protection system at this level is best left to the system or application developers. Nevertheless, whenever appropriate, we provide helpful primitives to simplify developers' tasks. One such primitive is the <span class="apiname">SignedObject</span> class, whose detail we will describe later.

                  <div>
                     <p>The permission classes represent access to system resources. The <span class="apiname">java.security.Permission</span> class is an abstract class and is subclassed, as appropriate, to represent specific accesses. 
                     </p>
                     <p>As an example of a permission, the following code can be used to produce a permission to read the file named <code>abc</code> in the <code>/tmp</code> directory:
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    perm = new java.io.FilePermission("/tmp/abc", "read");
</code></pre><p>New permissions are subclassed either from the <span class="apiname">Permission</span> class or one of its subclasses, such as <span class="apiname">java.security.BasicPermission</span>. Subclassed permissions (other than <span class="apiname">BasicPermission</span>) generally belong to their own packages. Thus, <span class="apiname">FilePermission</span> is found in the <span class="apiname">java.io</span> package. 
                     </p>
                     <p>A crucial abstract method that needs to be implemented for each new class of permission is the <code class="codeph">implies</code> method. Basically, "a implies b" means that if one is granted permission "a", one is naturally granted permission "b". This is important when making access control decisions.

                     <p>Associated with the abstract class <span class="apiname">java.security.Permission</span> are the abstract class named <span class="apiname">java.security.PermissionCollection</span> and the final class <span class="apiname">java.security.Permissions</span>.

                     <p>Class <span class="apiname">java.security.PermissionCollection</span> represents a collection (i.e., a set that allows duplicates) of <span class="apiname">Permission</span> objects for a single category (such as file permissions), for ease of grouping. In cases where permissions can be added to the <span class="apiname">PermissionCollection</span> object in any order, such as for file permissions, it is crucial that the <span class="apiname">PermissionCollection</span> object ensure that the correct semantics are followed when the <code class="codeph">implies</code> function is called.

                     <p>Class <span class="apiname">java.security.Permissions</span> represents a collection of collections of <span class="apiname">Permission</span> objects, or in other words, a super collection of heterogeneous permissions.
                     </p>
                     <p>Applications are free to add new categories of permissions that the system supports. How to add such application-specific permissions is discussed later in this document.</p>
                     <p>Now we describe the syntax and semantics of all built-in permissions.</p>

                        <p>Each permission instance is typically generated by passing one or more string parameters to the constructor. In a common case with two parameters, the first parameter is usually "the name of the target" (such as the name of a file for which the permission is aimed), and the second parameter is the action (such as "read" action on a file). Generally, a set of actions can be specified together as a comma-separated composite string.</p>

                     <div>
                        <p>Recall that the internal state of a security policy is normally expressed by the permission objects that are associated with each code source. Given the dynamic nature of Java technology, however, it is possible that when the policy is initialized the actual code that implements a particular permission class has not yet been loaded and defined in the Java application environment. For example, a referenced permission class may be in a JAR file that will later be loaded. </p>
                        <p>The <span class="apiname">UnresolvedPermission</span> class is used to hold such "unresolved" permissions. Similarly, the class <span class="apiname">java.security.UnresolvedPermissionCollection</span> stores a collection of <span class="apiname">UnresolvedPermission</span> permissions.
                        </p>
                        <p>During access control checking on a permission of a type that was previously unresolved, but whose class has since been loaded, the unresolved permission is "resolved" and the appropriate access control decision is made. That is, a new object of the appropriate class type is instantiated, if possible, based on the information in the <span class="apiname">UnresolvedPermission</span>. This new object replaces the <span class="apiname">UnresolvedPermission</span>, which is removed. If the permission is still unresolvable at this time, the permission is considered invalid, as if it is never granted in a security policy.

directory (same as directory/)
directory/file
directory/* (all files in this directory)
* (all files in the current directory)
directory/- (all files in the file system under this directory)
- (all files in the file system under the current directory)
"&lt;&lt;ALL FILES&gt;&gt;" (all files in the file system)
</code></pre><p> Note that <code class="codeph">&lt;&lt;ALL FILES&gt;&gt;</code> is a special string denoting all files in the system. On a Solaris, Linux, or macOS system, this includes all files under the root directory. On a Windows system, this includes all files on all drives. 
                        </p>
                        <p> The actions are: <span class="bold">read</span>, <span class="bold">write</span>, <span class="bold">delete</span>, and <span class="bold">execute</span>. Therefore, the following are valid code samples for creating file permissions:
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>import java.io.FilePermission;

FilePermission p = new FilePermission("myfile", "read,write");
FilePermission p = new FilePermission("/home/gong/", "read");

                           <p class="notep1">Note:</p>
                           <p>Most of these strings are given in platform-dependent format. For example, to represent read access to the file named <code>foo</code> in the <code>temp</code> directory on the <code>C</code> drive of a Windows system, you would use
                           </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>FilePermission p = new FilePermission("c:\\temp\\foo", "read");
</code></pre><p> The double backslashes are necessary to represent a single backslash because the strings are processed by a tokenizer (<span class="apiname">java.io.StreamTokenizer</span>), which allows <code class="codeph">\</code> to be used as an escape string (e.g., <code class="codeph">\n</code> to indicate a new line) and which thus requires two backslashes to indicate a single backslash. After the tokenizer has processed the above <span class="apiname">FilePermission</span> target string, converting double backslashes to single backslashes, the end result is the actual path:
                           </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"c:\temp\foo"
</code></pre><p>It is necessary that the strings be given in platform-dependent format until there is a universal file description language. Note also that the use of meta symbols such as <code class="codeph">*</code> and <code class="codeph">-</code> prevents the use of specific file names. We think this is a small limitation that can be tolerated for the moment. Finally, note that <code class="codeph">-/</code> and <code class="codeph">&lt;&lt;ALL FILES&gt;&gt;</code> are the same target on Solaris, Linux, and macOS systems in that they both refer to the entire file system. (They can refer to multiple file systems if they are all available). The two targets are potentially different on other operating systems, such as Windows and macOS. 
                           </p>
                           <p>Also note that a target name that specifies just a directory, with a "read" action, as in</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>FilePermission p = new FilePermission("/home/gong/", "read");
</code></pre><p>means you are only giving permission to list the files in that directory, not read any of them. To allow read access to files, you must specify either an explicit file name, or an <code class="codeph">*</code> or <code class="codeph">-</code>, as in 
                           </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>FilePermission p = new FilePermission("/home/gong/myfile", "read");
FilePermission p = new FilePermission("/home/gong/*", "read");
FilePermission p = new FilePermission("/home/gong/-", "read");
</code></pre><p>And finally, note that code always automatically has permission to read files from its same (URL) location, and subdirectories of that location; it does not need explicit permission to do so.</p>

The naming convention follows the hierarchical property naming convention. An asterisk may appear at the end of the name, following a ".", or by itself, to signify a wildcard match. For example: "java.*" or "*" is valid, "*java" or "a*b" is not valid.

                     <div>
                        <p> Recall that permissions are often compared against each other, and to facilitate such comparisons, we require that each permission class defines an <code class="codeph">implies</code> method that represents how the particular permission class relates to other permission classes. For example, <code class="codeph">java.io.FilePermission("/tmp/*", "read")</code> implies <code class="codeph">java.io.FilePermission("/tmp/a.txt", "read")</code> but does not imply any <span class="apiname">java.net.NetPermission</span>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>There is another layer of implication that may not be immediately obvious to some readers. Suppose that one applet has been granted the permission to write to the entire file system. This presumably allows the applet to replace the system binary, including the JVM runtime environment. This effectively means that the applet has been granted all permissions.</p>
                        <p>Another example is that if an applet is granted the runtime permission to create class loaders, it is effectively granted many more permissions, as a class loader can perform sensitive operations.</p>
                        <p>Other permissions that are "dangerous" to give out include those that allow the setting of system properties, runtime permissions for defining packages and for loading native code libraries (because the Java security architecture is not designed to and does not prevent malicious behavior at the level of native code), and of course the <span class="apiname">AllPermission</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>For more information about permissions, including tables enumerating the risks of assigning specific permissions as well as a table of all the JDK built-in methods that require permissions, see <a href="permissions-jdk1.html#GUID-1E8E213A-D7F2-49F1-A2F0-EFB3397A8C95" title="A permission represents access to a system resource.

                     <div>
                        <p> It is essential that no one except Oracle should extend the permissions that are built into the JDK, either by adding new functionality or by introducing additional target keywords into a class such as <span class="apiname">java.lang.RuntimePermission</span>. This maintains consistency. 
                        </p>
                        <p> To create a new permission, the following steps are recommended, as shown by an example. Suppose an application developer from company ABC wants to create a customized permission to "watch TV".</p>
                        <p> First, create a new class <code class="codeph">com.abc.Permission</code> that extends the abstract class <span class="apiname">java.security.Permission</span> (or one of its subclasses), and another new class <code class="codeph">com.abc.TVPermission</code> that extends the <span class="apiname">com.abc.Permission</span>. Make sure that the <code class="codeph">implies</code> method, among others, is correctly implemented. (Of course, <code class="codeph">com.abc.TVPermission</code> can directly extend <span class="apiname">java.security.Permission</span>; the intermediate <code class="codeph">com.abc.Permission</code> is not required.)
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>public class com.abc.Permission extends java.security.Permission

public class com.abc.TVPermission extends com.abc.Permission
</code></pre><p>The following figure shows the subclass relationship. </p>
                        <p><span><img src="img/jssec_dt_031_anc8.png" alt="Description of jssec_dt_031_anc8.eps follows" title="Description of jssec_dt_031_anc8.eps follows" longdesc="img_text/jssec_dt_031_anc8.html"><br><a href="img_text/jssec_dt_031_anc8.html">Description of the illustration jssec_dt_031_anc8.eps</a></span></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>Second, include these new classes with the application package.</p>
                        <p>Each user that wants to allow this new type of permission for specific code does so by adding an entry in a policy file. (Details of the policy file syntax are given in a later section.) An example of a policy file entry granting code from <code class="codeph">http://example.com/</code> permission to watch channel 5 would be:
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant codeBase  "http://example.com/" {
    permission com.abc.TVPermission "channel-5", "watch";
}
</code></pre><p> In the application's resource management code, when checking to see if a permission should be granted, call <span class="apiname">AccessController</span>'s <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method using a <code class="codeph">com.abc.TVPermission</code> object as the parameter.
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>   com.abc.TVPermission tvperm = new
        com.abc.TVPermission("channel-5", "watch");
   AccessController.checkPermission(tvperm);
</code></pre><p>Note that, when adding a new permission, one should create a new (permission) class and not add a new method to the security manager. (In the past, in order to enable checking of a new type of access, you had to add a new method to the <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> class.) 
                        </p>
                        <p> If more elaborate <code class="codeph">TVPermissions</code> such as "channel-1:13" or "channel-*" are allowed, then it may be necessary to implement a <code class="codeph">TVPermissionCollection</code> object that knows how to deal with the semantics of these pseudo names.
                        </p>
                        <p> New code should always invoke a permission check by calling the <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method of the <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> class in order to exercise the built-in access control algorithm. There is no essential need to examine whether there is a <span class="apiname">ClassLoader</span> or a <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span>. On the other hand, if the algorithm should be left to the installed security manager class, then the method <code class="codeph">SecurityManager.checkPermission</code> should be invoked instead.

                  <div>
                     <p>The system security policy for a Java application environment, specifying which permissions are available for code from various sources, is represented by a <span class="apiname">Policy</span> object. More specifically, it is represented by a <span class="apiname">Policy</span> subclass providing an implementation of the abstract methods in the <span class="apiname">Policy</span> class. 
                     </p>
                     <p>In order for an applet (or an application running under a <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span>) to be allowed to perform secured actions, such as reading or writing a file, the applet (or application) must be granted permission for that particular action. The only exception is that code always automatically has permission to read files from its same <span class="apiname">CodeSource</span>, and subdirectories of that <span class="apiname">CodeSource</span>; it does not need explicit permission to do so.
                     </p>
                     <p>There could be multiple instances of the <span class="apiname">Policy</span> object, although only one is "in effect" at any time. The currently-installed <span class="apiname">Policy</span> object can be obtained by calling the <code class="codeph">getPolicy</code> method, and it can be changed by a call to the <code class="codeph">setPolicy</code> method (by code with permission to reset the Policy).
                     </p>
                     <p>The source location for the policy information utilized by the <span class="apiname">Policy</span> object is up to the Policy implementation. The policy configuration may be stored, for example, as a flat ASCII file, as a serialized binary file of the <span class="apiname">Policy</span> class, or as a database. There is a <span class="apiname">Policy</span> reference implementation that obtains its information from static policy configuration files.
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="sect4"><a id="GUID-F5270083-CCAC-49E0-ACAC-50176FBFDD97" name="GUID-F5270083-CCAC-49E0-ACAC-50176FBFDD97"></a><h5 id="JSSEC-GUID-F5270083-CCAC-49E0-ACAC-50176FBFDD97" class="sect5">Policy File Format</h5>
                     <div>
                        <p> In the Policy reference implementation, the policy can be specified within one or more policy configuration files. The configuration files indicate what permissions are allowed for code from specified code sources. Each configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8.</p>
                        <p>A policy configuration file essentially contains a list of entries. It may contain a keystore entry, and contains zero or more grant entries.</p>
                        <p>A keystore is a database of private keys and their associated digital certificates such as X.509 certificate chains authenticating the corresponding public keys. The <code class="codeph">keytool</code> utility is used to create and administer keystores. The keystore specified in a policy configuration file is used to look up the public keys of the signers specified in the grant entries of the file. A keystore entry must appear in a policy configuration file if any grant entries specify signer aliases, or if any grant entries specify a principal alias (see below).
                        </p>
                        <p>At this time, there can be only one keystore entry in the policy file (others after the first one are ignored), and it can appear anywhere outside the file's grant entries . It has the following syntax:</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>keystore "<span class="variable" translate="no">some_keystore_url</span>", "<span class="variable" translate="no">keystore_type</span>";
</code></pre><p> Here, <code class="codeph"><span class="variable" translate="no">some_keystore_url</span></code> specifies the URL location of the keystore, and <code class="codeph"><span class="variable" translate="no">keystore_type</span></code> specifies the keystore type. The latter is optional. If not specified, the type is assumed to be that specified by the <code class="codeph"><span class="variable" translate="no">keystore.type</span></code> property in the security properties file. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The URL is relative to the policy file location. Thus if the policy file is specified in the security properties file as:</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>policy.url.1=http://foo.bar.example.com/blah/some.policy
</code></pre><p>and that policy file has an entry: </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>keystore ".keystore";
</code></pre><p>then the keystore will be loaded from: </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>http://foo.bar.example.com/blah/.keystore
</code></pre><p>The URL can also be absolute. </p>
                        <p>A keystore type defines the storage and data format of the keystore information, and the algorithms used to protect private keys in the keystore and the integrity of the keystore itself. The Oracle JDK's default keystore type is PKCS12.</p>
                        <p> Each grant entry in a policy file essentially consists of a <span class="apiname">CodeSource</span> and its permissions. Actually, a <span class="apiname">CodeSource</span> consists of a URL and a set of certificates, while a policy file entry includes a URL and a list of signer names. The system creates the corresponding <span class="apiname">CodeSource</span> after consulting the keystore to determine the certificate(s) of the specified signers.
                        </p>
                        <p> Each grant entry in the policy file is of the following format, where the leading <code class="codeph">grant</code> is a reserved word that signifies the beginning of a new entry and optional items appear in brackets. Within each entry, a leading <code class="codeph">permission</code> is another reserved word that marks the beginning of a new permission in the entry. Each grant entry grants a set of permissions to a specified code source and principals.
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant [SignedBy "signer_names"] [, CodeBase "URL"]
      [, Principal [principal_class_name] "principal_name"]
      [, Principal [principal_class_name] "principal_name"] ... {
    permission permission_class_name [ "target_name" ] 
               [, "action"] [, SignedBy "signer_names"];
    permission ...
};
</code></pre><p>White spaces are allowed immediately before or after any comma. The name of the permission class must be a fully qualified class name, such as <span class="apiname">java.io.FilePermission</span>, and cannot be abbreviated (for example, to <span class="apiname">FilePermission</span>). 
                        </p>
                        <p>Note that the action field is optional in that it can be omitted if the permission class does not require it. If it is present, then it must come immediately after the target field.</p>
                        <p>The exact meaning of a CodeBase URL value depends on the characters at the end. A CodeBase with a trailing "/" matches all class files (not JAR files) in the specified directory. A CodeBase with a trailing "/*" matches all files (both class and JAR files) contained in that directory. A CodeBase with a trailing "/-" matches all files (both class and JAR files) in the directory and recursively all files in subdirectories contained in that directory.</p>
                        <p>The CodeBase field (URL) is optional in that, if it is omitted, it signifies "any code base".</p>
                        <p>The first signer name field is a string alias that is mapped, via a separate mechanism, to a set of public keys (within certificates in the keystore) that are associated with the signers. These keys are used to verify that certain signed classes are really signed by these signers.</p>
                        <p>This signer field can be a comma-separated string containing names of multiple signers, an example of which is <code class="codeph">Adam,Eve,Charles</code>, which means signed by Adam and Eve and Charles (i.e., the relationship is AND, not OR).
                        </p>

</code></pre><p>Now we give some examples. The following policy grants permission <code class="codeph">a.b.Foo</code> to code signed by <code class="codeph">Roland</code>: 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant signedBy "Roland" {
    permission a.b.Foo;

</code></pre><p>The following grants a <span class="apiname">FilePermission</span> to all code (regardless of the signer and/or CodeBase): 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant {
   permission java.io.FilePermission ".tmp", "read";
};
</code></pre><p>The following grants two permissions to code that is signed by both <code class="codeph">Li</code> and <code class="codeph">Roland</code>: 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant signedBy "Roland,Li" {
  permission java.io.FilePermission "/tmp/*", "read";
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.*";
};
</code></pre><p>The following grants two permissions to code that is signed by <code class="codeph">Li</code> and that comes from <code class="codeph">http://example.com</code>:
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant codeBase "http://example.com/*", signedBy "Li" {
    permission java.io.FilePermission "/tmp/*", "read";
    permission java.io.SocketPermission "*", "connect";
};
</code></pre><p>The following grants two permissions to code that is signed by both <code class="codeph">Li</code> and <code class="codeph">Roland</code>, and only if the bytecodes implementing <code class="codeph">com.abc.TVPermission</code> are genuinely signed by <code class="codeph">Li</code>. 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant signedBy "Roland,Li" {
  permission java.io.FilePermission "/tmp/*", "read";
  permission com.abc.TVPermission "channel-5", "watch", 
     signedBy "Li";
};
</code></pre><p>The reason for including the second signer field is to prevent spoofing when a permission class does not reside with the Java runtime installation. For example, a copy of the <code class="codeph">com.abc.TVPermission</code> class can be downloaded as part of a remote JAR archive, and the user policy might include an entry that refers to it. Because the archive is not long-lived, the second time the <code class="codeph">com.abc.TVPermission</code> class is downloaded, possibly from a different web site, it is crucial that the second copy is authentic, as the presence of the permission entry in the user policy might reflect the user's confidence or belief in the first copy of the class bytecode. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The reason we chose to use digital signatures to ensure authenticity, rather than storing (a hash value of) the first copy of the bytecodes and using it to compare with the second copy, is because the author of the permission class can legitimately update the class file to reflect a new design or implementation.</p>

The above examples have shown strings appropriate on Solaris.

After the tokenizer has processed the above <span class="apiname">FilePermission</span> target string, converting double backslashes to single backslashes, the end result is the actual path:
                           </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"C:\users\Cathy\*"

                     <div>
                        <p>Property expansion is possible in policy files and in the security properties file. Property expansion is similar to expanding variables in a shell. That is, when a string like <code class="codeph">${some.property}</code> appears in a policy file, or in the security properties file, it will be expanded to the value of the specified system property. For example,
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>permission java.io.FilePermission "${user.home}", "read";
</code></pre><p>will expand <code class="codeph">${user.home}</code> to use the value of the <code class="codeph">user.home</code> system property. If that property's value is <code>/home/cathy</code>, then the above is equivalent to
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>permission java.io.FilePermission "/home/cathy", "read";
</code></pre><p>In order to assist in platform-independent policy files, you can also use the special notation of <code class="codeph">${/}</code>, which is a shortcut for <code class="codeph">${file.separator}</code>. This allows permission designations such as
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>permission java.io.FilePermission "${user.home}${/}*", "read";
</code></pre><p>If <code class="codeph">user.home</code> is <code>/home/cathy</code>, and you are on Solaris, the above gets converted to: 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>permission java.io.FilePermission "/home/cathy/*", "read";
</code></pre><p>If on the other hand <code class="codeph">user.home</code> is <code>C:\users\cathy</code> and you are on a Windows system, the above gets converted to: 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>permission java.io.FilePermission "C:\users\cathy\*", "read";
</code></pre><p>Also, as a special case, if you expand a property in a codebase, such as </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant codeBase "file:/${java.home}/lib/ext/"
</code></pre><p>then any <code class="codeph">file.separator</code> characters will be automatically converted to slashes (<code class="codeph">/</code>), which is desirable since codebases are URLs. Thus on a Windows system, even if <code class="codeph">java.home</code> is set to <code>C:\j2sdk1.2</code>, the above would get converted to
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant codeBase "file:/C:/j2sdk1.2/lib/ext/"
</code></pre><p>Thus you don't need to use <code class="codeph">${/}</code> in codebase strings (and you shouldn't). 
                        </p>
                        <p>Property expansion takes place anywhere a double quoted string is allowed in the policy file. This includes the <code class="codeph">signedby</code>, <code class="codeph">codebase</code>, target names, and action fields.
                        </p>
                        <p>Whether or not property expansion is allowed is controlled by the value of the <code class="codeph">policy.expandProperties</code> property in the Security Properties file. If the value of this Security Property is true (the default), expansion is allowed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Please note: You can't use nested properties; they will not work. For example,</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"${user.${foo}}"
</code></pre><p> doesn't work, even if the <code class="codeph">foo</code> property is set to <code class="codeph">home</code>. The reason is the property parser doesn't recognize nested properties; it simply looks for the first <code class="codeph">${</code>, and then keeps looking until it finds the first <code class="codeph">}</code> and tries to interpret the result <code class="codeph">${user.$foo}</code> as a property, but fails if there is no such property. 
                        </p>
                        <p> Also note: If a property can't be expanded in a grant entry, permission entry, or keystore entry, that entry is ignored. For example, if the system property <code class="codeph">foo</code> is not defined and you have:
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant codeBase "${foo}" {
  permission ...;
  permission ...;
};
</code></pre><p>then all the permissions in this grant entry are ignored. If you have </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant {
  permission Foo "${foo}";
  permission Bar;
};
</code></pre><p>then only the <code class="codeph">permission Foo "${foo}";</code> entry is ignored. And finally, if you have 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>keystore "${foo}";
</code></pre><p>then the keystore entry is ignored. </p>
                        <p>One final note: On Windows systems, when you directly specify a file path in a string, you need to include two backslashes for each actual single backslash in the path, as in</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"C:\\users\\cathy\\foo.bat"
</code></pre><p>This is because the strings are processed by a tokenizer (<span class="apiname">java.io.StreamTokenizer</span>), which allows the backslash (<code class="codeph">\</code>) to be used as an escape string (e.g., <code class="codeph">\n</code> to indicate a new line) and which thus requires two backslashes to indicate a single backslash. After the tokenizer has processed the above string, converting double backslashes to single backslashes, the end result is
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"C:\users\cathy\foo.bat"
</code></pre><p>Expansion of a property in a string takes place <span class="bold">after</span> the tokenizer has processed the string. Thus if you have the string 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"${user.home}\\foo.bat"
</code></pre><p>then first the tokenizer processes the string, converting the double backslashes to a single backslash, and the result is </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"${user.home}\foo.bat"
</code></pre><p>Then the <code class="codeph">${user.home}</code> property is expanded and the end result is 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"C:\users\cathy\foo.bat"
</code></pre><p>assuming the <code class="codeph">user.home</code> value is <code>C:\users\cathy</code>. Of course, for platform independence, it would be better if the string was initially specified without any explicit slashes, i.e., using the <code class="codeph">${/}</code> property instead, as in 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"${user.home}${/}foo.bat"
</code></pre></div>

                     <div>
                        <p>Generalized forms of expansion are also supported in policy files. For example, permission names may contain a string of the form: <code class="codeph">${{<span class="variable" translate="no">protocol</span>:<span class="variable" translate="no">protocol_data</span>}}</code> If such a string occurs in a permission name, then the value in <code class="codeph"><span class="variable" translate="no">protocol</span></code> determines the exact type of expansion that should occur, and <code class="codeph"><span class="variable" translate="no">protocol_data</span></code> is used to help perform the expansion. <code class="codeph"><span class="variable" translate="no">protocol_data</span></code> may be empty, in which case the above string should simply take the form:
                        </p>
                        <p><code class="codeph">${{<span class="variable" translate="no">protocol</span>}}</code> 
                        </p>
                        <p>There are two protocols supported in the default policy file implementation:</p>
                        <ol>
                           <li>
                              <p><code class="codeph">${{self}}</code></p>
                              <p>The protocol, <code class="codeph">self</code>, denotes a replacement of the entire string, <code class="codeph">${{self}}</code>, with one or more principal class/name pairs. The exact replacement performed depends upon the contents of the grant clause to which the permission belongs.
                              </p>
                              <p>If the grant clause does not contain any principal information, the permission will be ignored (permissions containing <code class="codeph">${{self}}</code> in their target names are only valid in the context of a principal-based grant clause). For example, <code class="codeph">BarPermission</code> will always be ignored in the following grant clause:
                              </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant codebase "www.foo.example.com", signedby "duke" {
    permission BarPermission "... ${{self}} ...";
};</code></pre> If the grant clause contains principal information, <code class="codeph">${{self}}</code> will be replaced with that same principal information. For example, <code class="codeph">${{self}}</code> in <code class="codeph">BarPermission</code> will be replaced by <code class="codeph">javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal "cn=Duke"</code> in the following grant clause: <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>grant principal javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal "cn=Duke" {
    permission BarPermission "... ${{self}} ...";
};
</code></pre> If there is a comma-separated list of principals in the grant clause, then <code class="codeph">${{self}}</code> will be replaced by the same comma-separated list or principals. In the case where both the principal class and name are wildcarded in the grant clause, <code class="codeph">${{self}}</code> is replaced with all the principals associated with the <code class="codeph">Subject</code> in the current <code class="codeph">AccessControlContext</code>. 
                              <p>The following example describes a scenario involving both <code class="codeph">self</code> and <a href="java-se-platform-security-architecture.html#GUID-F5270083-CCAC-49E0-ACAC-50176FBFDD97__GUID-0BB07966-22BF-44C7-9200-21C4B1700432">KeyStore alias replacement</a> together:

    };       
</code></pre> In the above example, "duke" will first be expanded into <code class="codeph">javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal "cn=Duke"</code> assuming the X.509 certificate associated with the KeyStore alias, <code class="codeph">"duke"</code>, has a subject distinguished name of <code class="codeph">"cn=Duke"</code>. Next, <code class="codeph">${{self}}</code> will be replaced with the same principal information that just got expanded in the grant clause: <code class="codeph">javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal "cn=Duke"</code>.
                           </li>

The <code class="codeph">KeyStore</code> used is the one specified in the KeyStore entry; see <a href="java-se-platform-security-architecture.html#GUID-F5270083-CCAC-49E0-ACAC-50176FBFDD97">Policy File Format</a>. <code class="codeph"><span class="variable" translate="no">alias_name</span></code> represents an alias into the <code class="codeph">KeyStore</code>. <code class="codeph">${{alias:<span class="variable" translate="no">alias_name</span>}}</code> is replaced with <code class="codeph">javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal "<span class="variable" translate="no">DN</span>"</code>, where <code class="codeph"><span class="variable" translate="no">DN</span></code> represents the subject distinguished name of the certificate belonging to <code class="codeph"><span class="variable" translate="no">alias_name</span></code>. For example:

                permission BarPermission "... ${{alias:duke}} ...";
            };

                     <div>
                        <p>When a principal executes a class that originated from a particular <span class="apiname">CodeSource</span>, the security mechanism consults the policy object to determine what permissions to grant. This is done by invoking the <code class="codeph">getPermissions</code> or <code class="codeph">implies</code> method on the <span class="apiname">Policy</span> object that is installed in the VM. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Clearly, a given code source in a <span class="apiname">ProtectionDomain</span> can match the code source given in multiple entries in the policy, for example because the wildcard (<code class="codeph">*</code>) is allowed.
                        </p>
                        <p> The following algorithm is used to locate the appropriate set of permissions in the policy.</p>
                        <ol>
                           <li>
                              <p>Match the public keys, if code is signed.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>If a key is not recognized in the policy, then ignore the key.</p>
                              <p>If every key is ignored, then treat the code as unsigned.
</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>If the keys are matched or no signer was specified, then try to match all URLs in the policy for the keys.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>If the keys are matched (or no signer was specified) and the URLs are matched (or no codebase was specified), then try to match all principals in the policy with the principals associated with the current executing thread.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>If either key, URL, or principals are not matched, then use the built-in default permission, which is the original sandbox permission.</p>
                           </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The exact meaning of a policy entry codeBase URL value depends on the characters at the end. A codeBase with a trailing <code class="codeph">"/"</code> matches all class files (not JAR files) in the specified directory. A codeBase with a trailing <code class="codeph">"/*"</code> matches all files (both class and JAR files) contained in that directory. A codeBase with a trailing <code class="codeph">"/-"</code> matches all files (both class and JAR files) in the directory and recursively all files in subdirectories contained in that directory. 
                        </p>
                        <p> As an example, given <code class="codeph">"http://example.com/-"</code> in the policy, then any code base that is on this web site matches the policy entry. Matching code bases include <code class="codeph">"http://example.com/j2se/sdk/"</code> and <code class="codeph">"http://example.com/people/gong/appl.jar"</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p> If multiple entries are matched, then all the permissions given in those entries are granted. In other words, permission assignment is additive. For example, if code signed with key A gets permission X and code signed by key B gets permission Y and no particular codebase is specified, then code signed by both A and B gets permissions X and Y. Similarly, if code with codeBase <code class="codeph">"http://example.com/-"</code> is given permission X, and <code class="codeph">"http://example.com/people/*</code>" is given permission Y, and no particular signers are specified, then an applet from "http://example.com/people/applet.jar" gets both X and Y.
                        </p>
                        <p> Note that URL matching here is purely syntactic. For example, a policy can give an entry that specifies a URL <code class="codeph">"ftp://ftp.example.com"</code>. Such an entry is useful only when one can obtain Java code directly from ftp for execution.
                        </p>
                        <p>To specify URLs for the local file system, a file URL can be used. For example, to specify files in the <code>/home/cathy/temp</code> directory in a Solaris system, you'd use
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"file:/home/cathy/temp/*"
</code></pre><p> To specify files in the <code>temp</code> directory on the C drive in a Windows system, use 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"file:/c:/temp/*"
</code></pre><p>Note: codeBase URLs always use slashes (no backlashes), regardless of the platform they apply to. </p>
                        <p>You can also use an absolute path name such as</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>"/home/gong/bin/MyWonderfulJava"
</code></pre></div>

                        <p> The current design of the <span class="apiname">Policy</span> class is not as comprehensive as it could be. We have given the issues much thought and are progressing cautiously, partly to ensure that we define method calls that are appropriate for the most common cases. For the meantime, an alternative policy class can be given to replace the default policy class, as long as the former is a subclass of the abstract <span class="apiname">Policy</span> class and implements the <code class="codeph">getPermissions</code> method (and other methods as necessary).
                        </p>
                        <p> The <span class="apiname">Policy</span> reference implementation can be changed by resetting the value of the <span class="apiname">policy.provider</span> Security Property (in the Security Properties file, <code><span class="variable" translate="no">&lt;java-home&gt;</span>/conf/security/java.security</code>) to the fully qualified name of the desired <span class="apiname">Policy</span> implementation class.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Security Property <code>policy.provider</code> specifies the name of the policy class, and the default is the following:
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>policy.provider=sun.security.provider.PolicyFile
</code></pre><p> To customize, you can change the property value to specify another class, as in </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>policy.provider=com.mycom.MyPolicy
</code></pre><p> Note that the <span class="apiname">MyPolicy</span> class must be a subclass of <span class="apiname">java.security.Policy</span>. It is perhaps worth emphasizing that such an override of the policy class is a temporary solution and a more comprehensive policy API will probably make this unnecessary.

                     <p>Classes from different <span class="apiname">CodeSources</span>, or that are being executed on behalf of different principals, belong to different domains.
                     </p>
                     <p>Today all code shipped as part of the JDK is considered system code and run inside the unique system domain. Each applet or application runs in its appropriate domain, determined by policy.</p>
                     <p>It is possible to ensure that objects in any non-system domain cannot automatically discover objects in another non-system domain. This partition can be achieved by careful class resolution and loading, for example, using different classloaders for different domains. However, <span class="apiname">SecureClassLoader</span> (or its subclasses) can, at its choice, load classes from different domains, thus allowing these classes to co-exist within the same name space (as partitioned by a classloader).

                  <div>
                     <p>The <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> class is used for three purposes, each of which is described in further detail in sections below: 
                     </p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>to decide whether an access to a critical system resource is to be allowed or denied, based on the security policy currently in effect,</li>
                        <li>to mark code as being "privileged", thus affecting subsequent access determinations, and</li>
                        <li>to obtain a "snapshot" of the current calling context so access-control decisions from a different context can be made with respect to the saved context.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Any code that controls access to system resources should invoke <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> methods if it wishes to use the specific security model and access control algorithm utilized by these methods. If, on the other hand, the application wishes to defer the security model to that of the <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> installed at runtime, then it should instead invoke corresponding methods in the <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> class. 
                     </p>
                     <p>For example, the typical way to invoke access control has been the following code (taken from an earlier version of JDK):</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ClassLoader loader = this.getClass().getClassLoader();
if (loader != null) {
    SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (security != null) {
        security.checkRead("path/file");
    }
}
</code></pre><p> Under the current architecture, the check typically should be invoked whether or not there is a classloader associated with a calling class. It could be simply, for example: </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>FilePermission perm = new FilePermission("path/file", "read");
AccessController.checkPermission(perm);
</code></pre><p>The <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method examines the current execution context and makes the right decision as to whether or not the requested access is allowed. If it is, this check returns quietly. Otherwise, an <span class="apiname">AccessControlException</span> (a subclass of <span class="apiname">java.lang.SecurityException</span>) is thrown. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Note that there are (legacy) cases, for example, in some browsers, where whether there is a <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> installed signifies one or the other security state that may result in different actions being taken. For backward compatibility, the <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method on <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> can be used.
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
if (security != null) {
    FilePermission perm = new FilePermission("path/file", "read");
    security.checkPermission(perm);
}
</code></pre><p>We currently do not change this aspect of the <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> usage, but would encourage application developers to use new techniques introduced in the JDK in their future programming when the built-in access control algorithm is appropriate.
                     </p>
                     <p>The default behavior of the <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method is actually to call the <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method. A different <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> implementation may implement its own security management approach, possibly including the addition of further constraints used in determining whether or not an access is permitted.

                     <div>
                        <p>Suppose access control checking occurs in a thread of computation that has a chain of multiple callers (think of this as multiple method calls that cross the protection domain boundaries), as illustrated in the next figure. </p>
                        <p><span><img src="img/jssec_dt_027_anc1.png" alt="Description of jssec_dt_027_anc1.eps follows" title="Description of jssec_dt_027_anc1.eps follows" longdesc="img_text/jssec_dt_027_anc1.html"><br><a href="img_text/jssec_dt_027_anc1.html">Description of the illustration jssec_dt_027_anc1.eps</a></span></p>
                        <p>When the <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method of the <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> is invoked by the most recent caller (e.g., a method in the File class), the basic algorithm for deciding whether to allow or deny the requested access is as follows.
                        </p>
                        <p> If any caller in the call chain does not have the requested permission, <span class="apiname">AccessControlException</span> is thrown, unless the following is true &#x2013; a caller whose domain is granted the said permission has been marked as "privileged" (see the next section) and all parties subsequently called by this caller (directly or indirectly) all have the said permission. 
                        </p>
                        <p> There are obviously two implementation strategies: </p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                           <li>
                              <p> In an "eager evaluation" implementation, whenever a thread enters a new protection domain or exits from one, the set of effective permissions is updated dynamically.</p>
                              <p> The benefit is that checking whether a permission is allowed is simplified and can be faster in many cases. The disadvantage is that, because permission checking occurs much less frequently than cross-domain calls, a large percentage of permission updates are likely to be useless effort. </p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                           <li>
                              <p> In a "lazy evaluation" implementation, whenever permission checking is requested, the thread state (as reflected by the current state, including the current thread's call stack or its equivalent) is examined and a decision is reached to either deny or grant the particular access requested.</p>
                              <p>One potential downside of this approach is performance penalty at permission checking time, although this penalty would have been incurred anyway in the "eager evaluation" approach (albeit at earlier times and spread out among each cross-domain call). Our implementation so far has yielded acceptable performance, so we feel that lazy evaluation is the most economical approach overall. </p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Therefore, the algorithm for checking permissions is currently implemented as "lazy evaluation". Suppose the current thread traversed m callers, in the order of caller 1 to caller 2 to caller <code class="codeph">m</code>. Then caller m invoked the <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method. The basic algorithm <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> uses to determine whether access is granted or denied is the following (see subsequent sections for refinements):
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    for (int i = m; i &gt; 0; i--) {

        else if (<span class="italic">caller i is marked as privileged</span>) {
            if (<span class="italic">a context was specified in the call to doPrivileged</span>)

                }
            } else
                return;
        }
    }

    // Next, check the context inherited when the thread was created.
    // Whenever a new thread is created, the AccessControlContext at

                        <p>A static method in the <code class="codeph">AccessController</code> class allows code in a class instance to inform the <code class="codeph">AccessController</code> that a body of its code is "privileged" in that it is solely responsible for requesting access to its available resources, no matter what code caused it to do so. 
                        </p>
                        <p>That is, a caller can be marked as being "privileged" when it calls the <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> method. When making access control decisions, the <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method stops checking if it reaches a caller that was marked as "privileged" via a <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> call without a context argument (see a subsequent section for information about a context argument). If that caller's domain has the specified permission, no further checking is done and <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> returns quietly, indicating that the requested access is allowed. If that domain does not have the specified permission, an exception is thrown, as usual.
                        </p>
                        <p>The normal use of the "privileged" feature is as follows:</p>
                        <p>If you don't need to return a value from within the "privileged" block, do the following:</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  somemethod() {

       AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() {
           public Object run() {
               // privileged code goes here, for example:
               System.loadLibrary("awt");
               return null; // nothing to return
           }
       });
       ...normal code here...
  }
</code></pre><p><code class="codeph">PrivilegedAction</code> is an interface with a single method, named <code class="codeph">run</code>, that returns an Object. The above example shows creation of an anonymous inner class implementing that interface; a concrete implementation of the <code class="codeph">run</code> method is supplied. When the call to <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> is made, an instance of the <code class="codeph">PrivilegedAction</code> implementation is passed to it. The <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> method calls the <code class="codeph">run</code> method from the <code class="codeph">PrivilegedAction</code> implementation after enabling privileges, and returns the <code class="codeph">run</code> method's return value as the <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> return value, which is ignored in this example.

           }
         }
       );
       ...normal code here...
  }
</code></pre><p>If the action performed in your <code class="codeph">run</code> method could throw a "checked" exception (one listed in the <code class="codeph">throws</code> clause of a method), then you need to use the <code class="codeph">PrivilegedExceptionAction</code> interface instead of the <code class="codeph">PrivilegedAction</code> interface: 
                        </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  somemethod() throws FileNotFoundException {

</code></pre><p>Some important points about being privileged: Firstly, this concept only exists within a single thread. As soon as the privileged code completes, the privilege is guaranteed to be erased or revoked. </p>
                        <p>Secondly, in this example, the body of code in the <code class="codeph">run</code> method is privileged. However, if it calls less trustworthy code that is less privileged, that code will not gain any privileges as a result; a permission is only granted if the privileged code has the permission <span class="italic">and</span> so do all the subsequent callers in the call chain up to the <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> call.

                  <div>
                     <p>When a thread creates a new thread, a new stack is created. If the current security context was not retained when this new thread was created, then when <code class="codeph">AccessController.checkPermission</code> was called inside the new thread, a security decision would be made based solely upon the new thread's context, not taking into consideration that of the parent thread. 
                     </p>
                     <p>This clean stack issue would not be a security problem per se, but it would make the writing of secure code, and especially system code, more prone to subtle errors. For example, a non-expert developer might assume, quite reasonably, that a child thread (e.g., one that does not involve untrusted code) inherits the same security context from the parent thread (e.g., one that involves untrusted code). This would cause unintended security holes when accessing controlled resources from inside the new thread (and then passing the resources along to less trusted code), if the parent context was not in fact saved.</p>
                     <p>Thus, when a new thread is created, we actually ensure (via thread creation and other code) that it automatically inherits the parent thread's security context at the time of creation of the child thread, in such a way that subsequent <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> calls in the child thread will take into consideration the inherited parent context.
                     </p>
                     <p>In other words, the logical thread context is expanded to include both the parent context (in the form of an <span class="apiname">AccessControlContext</span>, described in the next section) and the current context, and the algorithm for checking permissions is expanded to the following. (Recall there are m callers up to the call to <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code>, and see the next section for information about the <span class="apiname">AccessControlContext</span> <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method.)
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    for (int i = m; i &gt; 0; i--) {

                     <p>Recall that the <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method performs security checks within the context of the current execution thread (including the inherited context). A difficulty arises when such a security check can only be done in a different context. That is, sometimes a security check that should be made within a given context will actually need to be done from within a different context. For example, when one thread posts an event to another thread, the second thread serving the requesting event would not have the proper context to complete access control, if the service requests access to controller resources. 
                     </p>
                     <p>To address this issue, we provide the <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> <code class="codeph">getContext</code> method and <span class="apiname">AccessControlContext</span> class. The <code class="codeph">getContext</code> method takes a "snapshot" of the current calling context, and places it in an <span class="apiname">AccessControlContext</span> object, which it returns. A sample call is the following:
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    AccessControlContext acc = AccessController.getContext();
</code></pre><p>This context captures relevant information so that an access control decision can be made by checking, from within a different context, against this context information. For example, one thread can post a request event to a second thread, while also supplying this context information. <span class="apiname">AccessControlContext</span> itself has a <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method that makes access decisions based on the context it encapsulates, rather than that of the current execution thread. Thus, the second thread can perform an appropriate security check if necessary by invoking the following:

               <div>
                  <p>Dynamic class loading is an important feature of the Java Virtual Machine because it provides the Java platform with the ability to install software components at run-time. It has a number of unique characteristics. First of all, lazy loading means that classes are loaded on demand and at the last moment possible. Second, dynamic class loading maintains the type safety of the Java Virtual Machine by adding link-time checks, which replace certain run-time checks and are performed only once. Moreover, programmers can define their own class loaders that, for example, specify the remote location from which certain classes are loaded, or assign appropriate security attributes to them. Finally, class loaders can be used to provide separate name spaces for various software components. For example, a browser can load applets from different web pages using separate class loaders, thus maintaining a degree of isolation between those applet classes. In fact, these applets can contain classes of the same name &#x2013; these classes are treated as distinct types by the Java Virtual Machine. </p>
                  <p>The class loading mechanism is not only central to the dynamic nature of the Java programming language. It also plays a critical role in providing security because the class loader is responsible for locating and fetching the class file, consulting the security policy, and defining the class object with the appropriate permissions.</p>
               </div>

                  <div>
                     <p>When loading a class, because there can be multiple instances of class loader objects in one Java Virtual Machine, an important question is how do we determine which class loader to use. The JDK has introduced multiple class loader classes are introduced that have distinct properties, so another important question is what type of class loader we should use. </p>
                     <p>The root of the class loader class hierarchy is an abstract class called <span class="apiname">java.lang.ClassLoader</span>. Class <span class="apiname">java.security.SecureClassLoader</span> is a subclass and a concrete implementation of the abstract <span class="apiname">ClassLoader</span> class. Class <span class="apiname">java.net.URLClassLoader</span> is a subclass of <span class="apiname">SecureClassLoader</span>.
                     </p>
                     <p> When creating a custom class loader class, one can subclass from any of the above class loader classes, depending on the particular needs of the custom class loader.</p>
                  </div>
               </div>
               <div class="sect3"><a id="GUID-24372B10-3942-4084-803F-8E5CD7F1B72C" name="GUID-24372B10-3942-4084-803F-8E5CD7F1B72C"></a><h4 id="JSSEC-GUID-24372B10-3942-4084-803F-8E5CD7F1B72C" class="sect4">The Primordial Class Loader</h4>
                  <div>
                     <p>Because each class is loaded by its class loader, and each class loader itself is a class and must be loaded by another class loader, we seem to have the obvious chicken-and-egg problem, i.e., where does the first class loader come from? There is a "primordial'' class loader that bootstraps the class loading process. The primordial class loader is generally written in a native language, such as C, and does not manifest itself within the Java context. The primordial class loader often loads classes from the local file system in a platform-dependent manner.</p>
                     <p>Some classes, such as those defined in the <span class="apiname">java.*</span> package, are essential for the correct functioning of the Java Virtual Machine and runtime system. They are often referred to as base classes. Due to historical reasons, all such classes have a class loader that is a null. This null class loader is perhaps the only sign of the existence of a primordial class loader. In fact, it is easier to simply view the null class loader as the primordial class loader.
                     </p>
                     <p>Given all classes in one Java application environment, we can easily form a class loading tree to reflect the class loading relationship. Each class that is not a class loader is a leaf node. Each class's parent node is its class loader, with the null class loader being the root class. Such a structure is a tree because there cannot be cycles &#x2013; a class loader cannot have loaded its own ancestor class loader.</p>
                  </div>
               </div>
               <div class="sect3"><a id="GUID-AEABE469-63AF-4041-B0F4-A283971DCFD6" name="GUID-AEABE469-63AF-4041-B0F4-A283971DCFD6"></a><h4 id="JSSEC-GUID-AEABE469-63AF-4041-B0F4-A283971DCFD6" class="sect4">Class Loader Delegation</h4>
                  <div>
                     <p>When one class loader is asked to load a class, this class loader either loads the class itself or it can ask another class loader to do so. In other words, the first class loader can delegate to the second class loader. The delegation relationship is virtual in the sense that it has nothing to do with which class loader loads which other class loader. Instead, the delegation relationship is formed when class loader objects are created, and in the form of a parent-child relationship. Nevertheless, the system class loader is the delegation root ancestor of all class loaders. Care must be taken to ensure that the delegation relationship does not contain cycles. Otherwise, the delegation process may enter into an infinite loop.</p>

                  <div>
                     <p>The default implementation of the JDK <span class="apiname">ClassLoader</span> method for loading a class searches for classes in the following order: 
                     </p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>Check if the class has already been loaded.</li>
                        <li>If the current class loader has a specified delegation parent, delegate to the parent to try to load this class. If there is no parent, delegate to the primordial class loader.</li>
                        <li>Call a customizable method to find the class elsewhere.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Here, the first step looks into the class loader's local cache (or its functional equivalent, such as a global cache) to see if a loaded class matches the target class. The last step provides a way to customize the mechanism for looking for classes; thus a custom class loader can override this method to specify how a class should be looked up. For example, an applet class loader can override this method to go back to the applet host and try to locate the class file and load it over the network. </p>
                     <p>If at any step a class is located, it is returned. If the class is not found using the above steps, a <span class="apiname">ClassNotFound</span> exception is thrown.
                     </p>
                     <p>Observe that it is critical for type safety that the same class not be loaded more than once by the same class loader. If the class is not among those already loaded, the current class loader attempts to delegate the task to the parent class loader. This can occur recursively. This ensures that the appropriate class loader is used. For example, when locating a system class, the delegation process continues until the system class loader is reached.</p>
                     <p>We have seen the delegation algorithm earlier. But, given the name of any class, which class loader do we start with in trying to load the class? The rules for determining the class loader are the following:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>When loading the first class of an application, a new instance of the <span class="apiname">URLClassLoader</span> is used.
                        </li>
                        <li>When loading the first class of an applet, a new instance of the <span class="apiname">AppletClassLoader</span> is used.
                        </li>
                        <li>When <span class="apiname">java.lang.Class.ForName</span> is directly called, the primordial class loader is used.
                        </li>
                        <li>If the request to load a class is triggered by a reference to it from an existing class, the class loader for the existing class is asked to load the class.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Note that rules about the use of <span class="apiname">URLClassLoader</span> and <span class="apiname">AppletClassLoader</span> instances have exceptions and can vary depending on the particular system environment. For example, a web browser may choose to reuse an existing <span class="apiname">AppletClassLoader</span> to load applet classes from the same web page.
                     </p>
                     <p>Due to the power of class loaders, we severely restrict who can create class loader instances. On the other hand, it is desirable to provide a convenient mechanism for applications or applets to specify URL locations and load classes from them. We provide static methods to allow any program to create instances of the <span class="apiname">URLClassLoader</span> class, although not other types of class loaders.

                  <div>
                     <p>Currently, all JDK system code invokes <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> methods to check the policy currently in effect and perform access control checks. There is typically a security manager (<span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> implementation) installed whenever an applet is running; the <span class="apiname">appletviewer</span> and most browsers install a security manager. 
                     </p>
                     <p>A security manager is not automatically installed when an application is running. To apply the same security policy to an application found on the local file system as to downloaded applets, either the user running the application must invoke the Java Virtual Machine with the <code class="codeph">-Djava.security.manager</code> command-line argument (which sets the value of the <code class="codeph">java.security.manager</code> property), as in
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    java -Djava.security.manager SomeApp
</code></pre><p>or the application itself must call the <code class="codeph">setSecurityManager</code> method in the <span class="apiname">java.lang.System</span> class to install a security manager. 
                     </p>
                     <p> It is possible to specify on the command line a particular security manager to be utilized, by following <code class="codeph">-Djava.security.manager</code> with an equals and the name of the class to be used as the security manager, as in
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    java -Djava.security.manager=COM.abc.MySecMgr SomeApp
</code></pre><p>If no security manager is specified, the built-in default security manager is utilized (unless the application installs a different security manager). All of the following are equivalent and result in usage of the default security manager:</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    java -Djava.security.manager SomeApp
    java -Djava.security.manager="" SomeApp
    java -Djava.security.manager=default SomeApp
</code></pre><p>The JDK includes a property named <code class="codeph">java.class.path</code>. Classes that are stored on the local file system but should not be treated as base classes (e.g., classes built into the SDK) should be on this path. Classes on this path are loaded with a secure class loader and are thus subjected to the security policy being enforced. 
                     </p>
                     <p>There is also a <code class="codeph">-Djava.security.policy</code> command-line argument whose usage determines what policy files are utilized. This command-line argument is described in detail in <a href="permissions-jdk1.html#GUID-789089CA-8557-4017-B8B0-6899AD3BA18D">Default Policy Implementation and Policy File Syntax</a>. Basically, if you don't include <code class="codeph">-Djava.security.policy</code> on the command line, then the policy files specified in the security properties file will be used.
                     </p>
                     <p>You can use a <code class="codeph">-Djava.security.policy</code> command-line argument to specify an additional or a different policy file when invoking execution of an application. For example, if you type the following, where <code class="codeph">pURL</code> is a URL specifying the location of a policy file, then the specified policy file will be loaded in addition to all the policy files specified in the security properties file:
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=pURL SomeApp
</code></pre><p>If you instead type the following command, using a double equals, then just the specified policy file will be used; all others will be ignored: </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy==pURL SomeApp

                  <div>
                     <p>The new access control mechanism is fully backward compatible. For example, all <code class="codeph">check</code> methods in <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> are still supported, although most of their implementations are changed to call the new <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method, whose default implementation calls the <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> <code class="codeph">checkPermission</code> method. Note that certain internal security checks may stay in the <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> class, unless it can be parameterized. 
                     </p>
                     <p>We have not at this time revised any system code to call <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> instead of calling <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> (and checking for the existence of a classloader), because of the potential of existing third-party applications that subclass the <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> and customize the <code class="codeph">check</code> methods. In fact, we added a new method <code class="codeph">SecurityManager.checkPermission</code> that by default simply invokes <code class="codeph">AccessController.checkPermission</code>.
                     </p>
                     <p>To understand the relationship between <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> and <span class="apiname">AccessController</span>, it is sufficient to note that <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> represents the concept of a central point of access control, while <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> implements a particular access control algorithm, with special features such as the <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> method. By keeping <span class="apiname">SecurityManager</span> up to date, we maintain backward compatibility (e.g., for those applications that have written their own security manager classes based on earlier versions of the JDK) and flexibility (e.g., for someone wanting to customize the security model to implement mandatory access control or multilevel security). By providing <span class="apiname">AccessController</span>, we build in the algorithm that we believe is the most restrictive and that relieves the typical programmer from the burden of having to write extensive security code in most scenarios.
                     </p>
                     <p>We encourage the use of <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> in application code, while customization of a security manager (via subclassing) should be the last resort and should be done with extreme care. Moreover, a customized security manager, such as one that always checks the time of the day before invoking standard security checks, could and should utilize the algorithm provided by <span class="apiname">AccessController</span> whenever appropriate.
                     </p>
                     <p>One thing to remember is that, when you implement your own <code class="codeph">SecurityManager</code>, you should install it as trusted software and grant it <code class="codeph">java.security.AllPermission</code>. You can do this by adjusting the policy file to grant <code class="codeph">AllPermission</code> to your <code class="codeph">SecurityManager</code>.

It enables users to administer their own public/private key pairs and associated certificates for use in self-authentication (where the user authenticates himself/herself to other users/services) or data integrity and authentication services, using digital signatures. The authentication information includes both a sequence (chain) of X.509 certificates, and an associated private key, which can be referenced by a so-called "alias". This tool also manages certificates (that are "trusted" by the user), which are stored in the same database as the authentication information, and can be referenced by an "alias".

Identities (including CAs) use their private keys to authenticate their association with objects (such as with channels which are secured using SSL), with archives of code they signed, or (for CAs) with X.509 certificates they have issued. As a bootstrapping tool, certificates generated using the -genkey command may be used until a Certification Authority returns a certificate chain.</p>
                        <p> The private keys in this database are always stored in encrypted form, to make it difficult to disclose these private keys inappropriately. A password is required to access or modify the database. These private keys are encrypted using the "password", which should be several words long. If the password is lost, those authentication keys cannot be recovered.</p>
                        <p> In fact, each private key in the keystore can be protected using its own individual password, which may or may not be the same as the password that protects the keystore's overall integrity.</p>

                  <div>
                     <p>Recall that the class <span class="apiname">AccessControlContext</span> is useful when an access control decision has to be made in a different context. There is another such scenario, where the supplier of a resource is not in the same thread as the consumer of that resource, and the consumer thread cannot provide the supplier thread the access control context information (because the context is security-sensitive, or the context is too large to pass, or for other reasons). For this case, we provide a class called <span class="apiname">GuardedObject</span> to protect access to the resource, illustrated in the figure below. 
                     </p>
                     <p><span><img src="img/jssec_dt_033_anca3.png" alt="The following paragraph described this figure." title="The following paragraph described this figure."></span></p>
                     <p>The basic idea is that the supplier of the resource can create an object representing the resource, create a <span class="apiname">GuardedObject</span> that embeds the resource object inside, and then provide the <span class="apiname">GuardedObject</span> to the consumer. In creating the <span class="apiname">GuardedObject</span>, the supplier also specifies a <span class="apiname">Guard</span> object such that anyone (including the consumer) can only obtain the resource object if certain (security) checks inside the <span class="apiname">Guard</span> are satisfied.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="apiname">Guard</span> is an interface, so any object can choose to become a <span class="apiname">Guard</span>. The only method in this interface is called <code class="codeph">checkGuard</code>. It takes an <span class="apiname">Object</span> argument and it performs certain (security) checks. The <span class="apiname">Permission</span> class in <span class="apiname">java.security</span> implements the <span class="apiname">Guard</span> interface.
                     </p>
                     <p> For example, suppose a system thread is asked to open a file <code>/a/b/c.txt</code> for read access, but the system thread does not know who the requestor is or under what circumstances the request is made. Therefore, the correct access control decision cannot be made at the server side. The system thread can use <span class="apiname">GuardedObject</span> to delay the access control checking, as follows.
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream("/a/b/c.txt");
    FilePermission p = new FilePermission("/a/b/c.txt", "read");
    GuardedObject g = new GuardedObject(f, p);
</code></pre><p>Now the system thread can pass g to the consumer thread. For that thread to obtain the file input stream, it has to call </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    FileInputStream fis = (FileInputStream) g.getObject();
</code></pre><p>This method in turn invokes the <code class="codeph">checkGuard</code> method on the <span class="apiname">Guard</span> object <code class="codeph">p</code>, and because <code class="codeph">p</code> is a <span class="apiname">Permission</span>, its <code class="codeph">checkGuard</code> method is in fact: 
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) sm.checkPermission(this);
</code></pre><p>This ensures that a proper access control check takes place within the consumer context. In fact, one can replace often-used hash tables and access control lists in many cases and simply store a hash table of <span class="apiname">GuardedObjects</span>. 
                     </p>
                     <p>This basic pattern of <span class="apiname">GuardedObject</span> and <span class="apiname">Guard</span> is very general, and we expect that by extending the basic <span class="apiname">Guard</span> and <span class="apiname">GuardedObject</span> classes, developers can easily obtain quite powerful access control tools. For example, per-method invocation can be achieved with an appropriate <span class="apiname">Guard</span> for each method, and a <span class="apiname">Guard</span> can check the time of the day, the signer or other identification of the caller, or any other relevant information.
                     </p>
                     <p>Note that certain typing information is lost because <span class="apiname">GuardedObject</span> returns an <span class="apiname">Object</span>. <span class="apiname">GuardedObject</span> is intended to be used between cooperating parties so that the receiving party should know what type of object to expect (and to cast for). In fact, we envision that most usage of <span class="apiname">GuardedObject</span> involves <span class="apiname">subclassing</span> it (say to form a <span class="apiname">GuardedFileInputStream</span> class), thus encapsulating typing information, and casting can happen suitably in the subclass.

                  <div>
                     <p> This class is an essential building block for other security primitives. <span class="apiname">SignedObject</span> contains another <span class="apiname">Serializable</span> object, the (to-be-)signed object and its signature. If the signature is not null, it contains a valid digital signature of the signed object. This is illustrated in the figure below. 
                     </p>
                     <p><span><img src="img/jssec_dt_034_anca9.png" alt="The previous paragraph describes this figure." title="The previous paragraph describes this figure."></span></p>
                     <p>The underlying signing algorithm is set through a Signature object as a parameter to the <code class="codeph">sign</code> method call, and the algorithm can be, among others, the NIST standard DSA, using DSA and SHA-256. The algorithm is specified using the same convention for signatures, such as "SHA/DSA".
                     </p>
                     <p>The signed object is a "deep copy" (in serialized form) of an original object. Once the copy is made, further manipulation of the original object has no side effect on the copy. A signed object is immutable.</p>
                     <p>A typical example of creating a signed object is the following:</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    Signature signingEngine = Signature.getInstance(algorithm,provider);
    SignedObject so = new SignedObject(myobject, signingKey, signingEngine);
</code></pre><p>A typical example of verification is the following (having received <span class="apiname">SignedObject</span> <code class="codeph">so</code>), where the first line is not needed if the name of the algorithm is known:
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>    String algorithm = so.getAlgorithm();
    Signature verificationEngine = Signature.getInstance(algorithm, provider);
    so.verify(verificationEngine);
</code></pre><p>Potential applications of <span class="apiname">SignedObject</span> include: 
                     </p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>It can be used internally to any Java application environment as an unforgeable authorization token &#x2013; one that can be passed around without the fear that the token can be maliciously modified without being detected.</li>
                        <li>It can be used to sign and serialize data/object for storage outside the Java runtime (e.g., storing critical access control data on disk).</li>
                        <li>Nested <span class="apiname">SignedObjects</span> can be used to construct a logical sequence of signatures, resembling a chain of authorization and delegation.
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>It is intended that this class can be subclassed in the future to allow multiple signatures on the same signed object. In that case, existing method calls in this base class will be fully compatible in semantics. In particular, any <code class="codeph">get</code> method will return the unique value if there is only one signature, and will return an arbitrary one from the set of signatures if there is more than one signature.

                     <p>Resource consumption management is relatively easy to implement in some cases (e.g., to limit the number of windows any application can pop up at any one time), while it can be quite hard to implement efficiently in other cases (e.g., to limit memory or file system usage).

                  <div>
                     <p>Sometimes it is convenient to group a number of permissions together and use a short-hand name to refer to them. For example, if we would like to have a permission called <code class="codeph">SuperPermission</code> to include (and imply) both <code class="codeph">FilePermission("-", "read,write")</code> and <code class="codeph">SocketPermission("*", "connect,accept")</code>, technically we can use the class <span class="apiname">Permissions</span> or a similar class to implement this super permission by using the <code class="codeph">add</code> methods to add the required permissions. And such grouping can be arbitrarily complicated.
                     </p>
                     <p>The more difficult issues are the following. First, to understand what actual permissions one is granting when giving out such a super permission, either a fixed and named permission class is created to denote a statically specified group of permissions, or the member permissions need to be spelled out in the policy file. Second, processing the policy (file) can become more complicated because the grouped permissions may need to be expanded. Moreover, nesting of grouped permission increases complexity even more.</p>
                  </div>
               </div>

                  <div>
                     <p>Given the object-oriented nature of the Java programming language, it is conceivable that developers will benefit from a set of appropriate object-level protection mechanisms that (1) goes beyond the natural protection provided by the Java programming language and that (2) supplements the thread-based access control mechanism. </p>
                     <p>One such mechanism is <span class="apiname">SignedObject</span>. Another is the <span class="apiname">SealedObject</span> class, which uses encryption to hide the content of an object.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="apiname">GuardedObject</span> is a general way to enforce access control at a per class/object per method level. This method, however, should be used only selectively, partly because this type of control can be difficult to administer at a high level.

                  <div>
                     <p>A potentially useful concept not currently implemented is that of "subdomains." A subdomain is one that is enclosed in another. A subdomain would not have more permissions or privileges than the domain of which it is a subpart. A domain could be created, for example, to selectively further limit what a program can do. </p>
                     <p>Often a domain is thought of as supporting inheritance: a subdomain would automatically inherit the parent domain's security attributes, except in certain cases where the parent further restricts the subdomain explicitly. Relaxing a subdomain by right amplification is a possibility with the notion of trusted code.</p>
                     <p>For convenience, we can think of the system domain as a single, big collection of all system code. For better protection, though, system code should be run in multiple system domains, where each domain protects a particular type of resource and is given a special set of rights. For example, if file system code and network system code run in separate domains, where the former has no rights to the networking resources and the latter has no rights to the file system resources, the risks and consequence of an error or security flaw in one system domain is more likely to be confined within its boundary.</p>

                  <div>
                     <p> The JAR and Manifest specifications on code signing allow a very flexible format. Classes within the same archive can be signed with different keys, and a class can be unsigned, signed with one key, or signed with multiple keys. Other resources within the archive, such as audio clips and graphic images, can also be signed or unsigned, just like classes can. </p>
                     <p> This flexibility brings about the issue of interpretation. The following questions need to be answered, especially when keys are treated differently:</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>
                           <p>Should images and audios be required to be signed with the same key if any class in the archive is signed?</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>If images and audios are signed with different keys, can they be placed in the same <code class="codeph">appletviewer</code> (or browser page), or should they be sent to different viewers for processing? 
                           </p>
                        </li>
                     </ol>
                     <p> These questions are not easy to answer, and require consistency across platforms and products to be the most effective. Our intermediate approach is to provide a simple answer &#x2013; all images and audio clips are forwarded to be processed within the same applet classloader, whether they are signed or not. This temporary solution will be improved once a consensus is reached. </p>
                     <p> Moreover, if a digital signature cannot be verified because the bytecode content of a class file does not match the signed hash value in the JAR, a security exception is thrown, as the original intention of the JAR author is clearly altered. Previously, there was a suggestion to run such code as untrusted. This idea is undesirable because the applet classloader allows the loading of code signed by multiple parties. This means that accepting a partially modified JAR file would allow an untrusted piece of code to run together with and access other code through the same classloader.</p>

                           <p>Note that the invocation of <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> with a lambda expression explicitly casts the lambda expression as of type <code class="codeph">PrivilegedAction&lt;Void&gt;</code>. Another version of the method <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> exists that takes an object of type <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/security/PrivilegedExceptionAction.html" target="_blank"><code class="codeph">PrivilegedExceptionAction</code></a>; see <a href="java-se-platform-security-architecture.html#GUID-FE22FB75-A320-40F3-94D4-87B7E6A0784A" title="If the action performed in your run method could throw a checked exception (one that must be listed in the throws clause of a method), then you need to use the PrivilegedExceptionAction interface instead of the PrivilegedAction interface.">Handling Exceptions</a>.

                           <p><code class="codeph">PrivilegedAction</code> is a functional interface with a single abstract method, named <code class="codeph">run</code>, that returns a value of type specified by its type parameter.
                           </p>
                           <p>Note that this example ignores the return value of the <code class="codeph">run</code> method. Also, depending on what <span class="italic">privileged code</span> actually consists of, you might have to make some changes due to the way inner classes work. For example, if <span class="italic">privileged code</span> throws an exception or attempts to access local variables, then you will have to make some changes, which is described later.
                           </p>
                           <p>Be <span class="italic">very</span> careful in your use of the <span class="italic">privileged</span> construct, and always remember to make the privileged code section as small as possible. That is, try to limit the code within the <code class="codeph">run</code> method to only what needs to be run with privileges, and do more general things outside the <code class="codeph">run</code> method. Also note that the call to <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> should be made in the code that wants to enable its privileges. Do not be tempted to write a utility class that itself calls <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> as that could lead to security holes. You can write utility classes for <code class="codeph">PrivilegedAction</code> classes though, as shown in the preceding example.

This variant of the <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> variant has three parameters, one of which you use to specify this subset of privileges. For example, the following excerpt asserts a privilege to retrieve system properties:
                           </p><pre class="codeblock"><code>// Returns the value of the specified property. All code
// is allowed to read the app.version and app.vendor

    );
}</code></pre><p>The first parameter of this version of <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> is of type <code class="codeph">java.security.PrivilegedAction</code>. In this example, the first parameter is a lambda expression that implements the functional interface <code class="codeph">PrivilegedAction</code> whose <code class="codeph">run</code> method returns the value of the system property specified by the parameter <code class="codeph">prop</code>.
                           </p>
                           <p>The second parameter of this version of <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> is of type <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/security/AccessControlContext.html" target="_blank"><span class="apiname">AccessControlContext</span></a>. Sometimes you need to perform an additional security check within a different context, such as a worker thread. You can obtain an <code class="codeph">AccessControlContext</code> instance from a particular calling context with the method <code class="codeph">AccessControlContext.getContext</code>. If you specify <code class="codeph">null</code> for this parameter (as in this example), then the invocation of <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> does not perform any additional security checks.
                           </p>
                           <p>The third parameter of this version of <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> is of type <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/security/Permission.html" target="_blank"><span class="apiname">Permission</span></a><code class="codeph">...</code>, which is a varargs parameter.

                        <p>The typical use case of the <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> method is to enable the method that invokes it to perform one or more actions that require permission checks without requiring the callers of the current method to have all the necessary permissions.
                        </p>
                        <div class="section">
                           <p> For example, the current method might need to open a file or make a network request for its own internal implementation purposes.</p>
                           <p>Before JDK 8, calls to <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> methods had only two parameters. They worked by granting temporary privileges to the calling method and stopping the normal full traversal of the stack for access checking when it reached that class, rather than continuing up the call stack where it might reach a method whose defining class does not have the required permission. Typically, the class that is calling <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> might have additional permissions that are not required in that code path and which might also be missing from some caller classes.
                           </p>
                           <p>Normally, these extra permissions are not exercised at runtime. Not elevating them through use of <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> helps to block exploitation of any incorrect code that could perform unintended actions. This is especially true when the <code class="codeph">PrivilegedAction</code> is more complex than usual, or when it calls code outside the class or package boundary that might evolve independently over time.
                           </p>
                           <p>The three-parameter variant of <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> is generally safer to use because it avoids unnecessarily elevating permissions that are not intended to be required. However, it executes less efficiently so simple or performance-critical code paths might choose not to use it.

                        <p>When coding the current method, you want to temporarily extend the permission of the calling method to perform an action.</p>
                        <div class="section">
                           <p>For example, a framework I/O API might have a general purpose method for opening files of a particular data format. This API would take a normal file path parameter and use it to open an underlying <code class="codeph">FileInputStream</code> using the calling code's permissions. However, this might also allow any caller to open the data files in a special directory that contains some standard demonstration samples.
                           </p>
                           <p>The callers of this API could be directly granted a <code class="codeph">FilePermission</code> for <span class="italic">read</span> access. However, it might not be convenient or possible for the security policy of the calling code to be updated. For example, the calling code could be a sandboxed applet.
                           </p>
                           <p>One way to implement this is for the code to check the incoming path and determine if it refers to a file in the special directory. If it does, then it would call <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code>, enabling all permissions, then open the file inside the <code class="codeph">PrivilegedAction</code>. If the file was not in the special directory, the code would open the file without using <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code>.
                           </p>
                           <p>This technique requires the implementation to carefully handle the requested file path to determine if it refers to the special shared directory. The file path must be canonicalized before calling <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> so that any relative path will be processed (and permission to read the <code class="codeph">user.dir</code> system property will be checked) prior to determining if the path refers to a file in the special directory. It must also prevent malicious "../" path elements meant to escape out of the special directory.
                           </p>
                           <p>A simpler and better implementation would use the variant of <code class="codeph">doPrivileged</code> with the third parameter. It would pass a <code class="codeph">FilePermission</code> with <span class="italic">read</span> access to the special directory as the third parameter. Then any manipulation of the file would be inside the <code class="codeph">PrivilegedAction</code>. This implementation is simpler and much less prone to contain a security flaw.

                  <div>
                     <p>Marking code as <span class="italic">privileged</span> enables a piece of trusted code to temporarily enable access to more resources than are available directly to the code that called it.
                     </p>
                     <p>The policy for a JDK installation specifies what permissions which types of system resource accesses &#x2013; are allowed for code from specified code sources. A <span class="italic">code source</span> (of type <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/security/CodeSource.html" target="_blank"><span class="apiname">CodeSource</span></a>) essentially consists of the code location (URL) and a reference to the certificates containing the public keys corresponding to the private keys used to sign the code (if it was signed).
                     </p>
                     <p>The policy is represented by a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/security/Policy.html" target="_blank"><span class="apiname">Policy</span></a> object. More specifically, it is represented by a <code class="codeph">Policy</code> subclass providing an implementation of the abstract methods in the <code class="codeph">Policy</code> class (which is in the <code class="codeph">java.security</code> package).
                     </p>
                     <p>The source location for the policy information used by the <code class="codeph">Policy</code> object depends on the <code class="codeph">Policy</code> implementation. The <code class="codeph">Policy</code> reference implementation obtains its information from policy configuration files. See <a href="permissions-jdk1.html#GUID-789089CA-8557-4017-B8B0-6899AD3BA18D">Default Policy Implementation and Policy File Syntax</a> for information about the <code class="codeph">Policy</code> reference implementation and the syntax that must be used in policy files it reads.
                     </p>
                     <p>A <span class="italic">protection domain</span> encompasses a <code class="codeph">CodeSource</code> instance and the permissions granted to code from that <code class="codeph">CodeSource</code>, as determined by the security policy currently in effect. Thus, classes signed by the same keys and from the same URL are typically placed in the same domain, and a class belongs to one and only one protection domain. (However, classes signed by the same keys and from the same URL but loaded by separate class loader instances are typically placed in separate domains.) Classes that have the same permissions but are from different code sources belong to different domains.
                     </p>
                     <p>Classes shipped with the JDK run-time image and loaded by the bootstrap class loader are granted <span class="apiname">AllPermission</span>. However, classes shipped with the JDK run-time image and loaded by the platform class loader are granted permissions as specified by the default policy of the JDK. Each module's classes are assigned a unique protection domain using the <span class="apiname">jrt</span> URL scheme and may only be granted the permissions necessary for them to function correctly, and not necessarily <span class="apiname">AllPermission</span>.
                     </p>
                     <p>Each applet or application runs in its appropriate domain, determined by its code source. For an applet (or an application running under a security manager) to be allowed to perform a secured action (such as reading or writing a file), the applet or application must be granted permission for that particular action.</p>
                     <p>More specifically, whenever a resource access is attempted, <span class="italic">all</span> code traversed by the execution thread up to that point must have permission for that resource access, <span class="italic">unless some code on the thread has been marked as <span class="bold">privileged</span></span>. That is, suppose that access control checking occurs in a thread of execution that has a chain of multiple callers. (Think of this as multiple method calls that potentially cross the protection domain boundaries.) When the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/security/AccessController.html#checkPermission-java.security.Permission-" target="_blank"><span class="apiname">AccessController.checkPermission</span></a> method is invoked by the most recent caller, the basic algorithm for deciding whether to allow or deny the requested access is as follows: If the code for any caller in the call chain does not have the requested permission, then an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/security/AccessControlException.html" target="_blank"><span class="apiname">AccessControlException</span></a> is thrown, <span class="italic">unless</span> the following is true: a caller whose code is granted the said permission has been marked as <span class="italic">privileged</span>, and all parties subsequently called by this caller (directly or indirectly) have the said permission.
                     </p>

                        <p class="notep1">Note:</p>The method <code class="codeph">AccessController.checkPermission</code> is normally invoked indirectly through invocations of specific <code class="codeph">SecurityManager</code> methods that begin with the word <code class="codeph">check</code> such as <code class="codeph">checkConnect</code> or through the method <code class="codeph">SecurityManager.checkPermission</code>. Normally, these checks only occur if a <code class="codeph">SecurityManager</code> has been installed; code checked by the <code class="codeph">AccessController.checkPermission</code> method first checks if the method <code class="codeph">System.getSecurityManager</code> returns null.
                     </div>
                     <p>Marking code as <span class="italic">privileged</span> enables a piece of trusted code to temporarily enable access to more resources than are available directly to the code that called it. This is necessary in some situations. For example, an application might not be allowed direct access to files that contain fonts, but the system utility to display a document must obtain those fonts, on behalf of the user. The system utility must become privileged in order to obtain the fonts.
