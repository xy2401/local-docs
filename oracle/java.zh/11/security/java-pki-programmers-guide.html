                  <div>
                     <p>Users of public key applications and systems must be confident that a subject's public key is genuine, i.e., that the associated private key is owned by the subject. Public key certificates are used to establish this trust.</p>
                     <p>A <span class="bold">public key (or identity) certificate</span> is a binding of a public key to an identity, which is digitally signed by the private key of another entity, often called a <span class="bold">Certification Authority</span> (CA). For the remainder of this section, the term CA is used to refer to an entity that signs a certificate.
                     </p>
                     <p>If the user does not have a trusted copy of the public key of the CA that signed the subject's public key certificate, then another public key certificate vouching for the signing CA is required. This logic can be applied recursively, until a chain of certificates (or <span class="bold">a certification path</span>) is discovered from a <span class="bold">trust anchor</span> or a <span class="bold">most-trusted CA</span> to the target subject (commonly referred to as the <span class="bold">end-entity</span>). The <span class="bold">most-trusted CA</span> is usually specified by a certificate issued to a CA that the user directly trusts. In general, a certification path is an ordered list of certificates, usually comprised of the end-entity's public key certificate and zero or more additional certificates. A certification path typically has one or more encodings, allowing it to be safely transmitted across networks and to different operating system architectures.
                     </p>
                     <p>The following figure illustrates a certification path from a most-trusted CA's public key (CA 1) to the target subject (Alice). The certification path establishes trust in Alice's public key through an intermediate CA named CA2.</p>

                     <!-- class="figure" -->
                     <p>A certification path must be validated before it can be relied on to establish trust in a subject's public key. Validation can consist of various checks on the certificates contained in the certification path, such as verifying the signatures and checking that each certificate has not been revoked. The PKIX standards define an algorithm for validating certification paths consisting of X.509 certificates.</p>
                     <p>Often a user may not have a certification path from a most-trusted CA to the subject. Providing services to build or discover certification paths is an important feature of public key enabled systems. <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2587.txt" target="_blank">RFC 2587</a> defines an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) schema definition that facilitates the discovery of X.509 certification paths using the LDAP directory service protocol.
                     </p>
                     <p>Building and validating certification paths is an important part of many standard security protocols such as SSL/TLS/DTLS, S/MIME, and IPsec. The Java Certification Path API provides a set of classes and interfaces for developers who need to integrate this functionality into their applications. This API benefits two types of developers: those who need to write service provider implementations for a specific certification path building or validation algorithm; and those who need to access standard algorithms for creating, building, and validating certification paths in an implementation-independent manner.</p>

                        <p>Basically, public key cryptography requires access to users' public keys. In a large-scale networked environment it is impossible to guarantee that prior relationships between communicating entities have been established or that a trusted repository exists with all used public keys. Certificates were invented as a solution to this public key distribution problem. Now a <span class="variable" translate="no">Certification Authority</span> (CA) can act as a <span class="variable" translate="no">Trusted Third Party</span>. CAs are entities (e.g., businesses) that are trusted to sign (issue) certificates for other entities. It is assumed that CAs will only create valid and reliable certificates as they are bound by legal agreements. There are many public Certification Authorities, such as <a href="http://www.verisign.com" target="_blank">VeriSign</a>, <a href="http://www.thawte.com" target="_blank">Thawte</a>, <a href="http://www.entrust.com" target="_blank">Entrust</a>, and so on. You can also run your own Certification Authority using products such as the Netscape/Microsoft Certificate Servers or the Entrust CA product for your organization.

                        <p>Probably the most widely visible application of X.509 certificates today is in web browsers (such as Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer) that support the TLS protocol. TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a security protocol that provides privacy and authentication for your network traffic. These browsers can only use this protocol with web servers that support TLS.</p>
                        <p>Other technologies that rely on X.509 certificates include:</p>

                        <p>There are two basic techniques used to get certificates:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                           <li>You can create one yourself (using the right tools, such as keytool).</li>
                           <li>You can ask a Certification Authority to issue you one (either directly or using a tool such as <span class="bold">keytool</span> to generate the request).
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> The main inputs to the certificate creation process are: </p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                           <li>Matched <span class="variable" translate="no">public and private keys</span>, generated using some special tools (such as keytool), or a browser. <span class="bold">Only the public key is ever shown to anyone else.</span> The private key is used to sign data; if someone knows your private key, they can masquerade as you ... perhaps forging legal documents attributed to you!
                           </li>
                           <li>You need to provide <span class="variable" translate="no">information about the entity being certified</span> (e.g., you). This normally includes information such as your name and organizational address. If you ask a CA to issue a certificate for you, you will normally need to provide proof to show correctness of the information.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you are asking a CA to issue you a certificate, you provide your public key and some information about you. You'll use a tool (such as keytool or a browser that supports Certificate Signing Request generation). to digitally sign this information, and send it to the CA. The CA will then generate the certificate and return it.</p>
                        <p>If you're generating the certificate yourself, you'll take that same information, add a little more (dates during which the certificate is valid, a serial number), and just create the certificate using some tool (such as keytool). Not everyone will accept self-signed certificates; one part of the value provided by a CA is to serve as a neutral and trusted introduction service, based in part on their verification requirements, which are openly published in their Certification Service Practices (CSP).</p>

For example, if a certificate has the KeyUsage extension marked critical and set to "keyCertSign" then if this certificate is presented during SSL communication, it should be rejected, as the certificate extension indicates that the associated private key should only be used for signing certificates and not for SSL use.

However, there are some exceptions, which will be noted in this guide and in the API specification. Multiple threads that need to access a single non-thread-safe object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating separate objects need not synchronize.

                        <p>Its main purpose is to group (and provide type safety for) all certification path parameter specifications. The <code class="codeph">CertPathParameters</code> interface extends the <code class="codeph">Cloneable</code> interface and defines a <code class="codeph">clone()</code> method that does not throw an exception.

                        <p>Unlike the <code class="codeph">java.security.KeyStore</code> class, which provides access to a cache of private keys and trusted certificates, a <code class="codeph">CertStore</code> is designed to provide access to a potentially vast repository of untrusted certificates and CRLs.

                           <p>The <code class="codeph">X509CertSelector</code> class is an implementation of the <code class="codeph">CertSelector</code> interface that defines a set of criteria for selecting X.509 certificates.
                           </p>
                           <p>An <code class="codeph">X509Certificate</code> object must match <span class="variable" translate="no">all</span> of the specified criteria to be selected by the <code class="codeph">match</code> method. The selection criteria are designed to be used by a <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> implementation to discover potential certificates as it builds an X.509 certification path.
                           </p>
                           <p>For example, the <code class="codeph">setSubject</code> method of <code class="codeph">X509CertSelector</code> allows a PKIX <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> to filter out <code class="codeph">X509Certificate</code>s that do not match the issuer name of the preceding <code class="codeph">X509Certificate</code> in a partially completed chain. By setting this and other criteria in an <code class="codeph">X509CertSelector</code> object, a <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> is able to discard irrelevant certificates and more easily find an X.509 certification path that meets the requirements specified in the <code class="codeph">CertPathParameters</code> object.

In addition, the <code class="codeph">setMaxPathLength</code> method can be called to place a limit on the maximum number of certificates in a certification path:
                           </p><pre class="codeblock"><code>
        public void setMaxPathLength(int maxPathLength)
</code></pre><p>The <code class="codeph">maxPathLength</code> parameter specifies the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates that may exist in a certification path. A <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> instance implementing the PKIX algorithm must not build paths longer than the length specified. If the value is 0, the path can only contain a single certificate. If the value is -1, the path length is unconstrained (i.e., there is no maximum). The default maximum path length, if not specified, is 5. This method is useful to prevent the <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> from spending resources and time constructing long paths that may or may not meet the caller's requirements.

                           <p>If any of the CA certificates in the path contain a Basic Constraints extension, the value of the pathLenConstraint component of the extension overrides the value of the <code class="codeph">maxPathLength</code> parameter whenever the result is a certification path of smaller length.

                        </p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

                              <p>If the revocation mechanism supplied by a PKIX <code class="codeph">CertPathValidator</code> or <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> implementation is not adequate: For example, you can use the <code class="codeph"><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/security/cert/PKIXRevocationChecker.html" target="_blank"><code class="codeph">PKIXRevocationChecker</code></a></code> (introduced in JDK 8; see <a href="java-pki-programmers-guide.html#GUID-43A3A247-E165-408C-AD74-88A75BFB4750" title="An instance of PKIXRevocationChecker checks the revocation status of certificates with the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).">Check Revocation Status of Certificates with PKIXRevocationChecker Class</a>) to have more control over the revocation mechanism, or you can implement your own <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> to check that certificates have not been revoked.

                              <p>If the user wants to recognize certificates containing a critical private extension. Since the extension is private, it will not be recognized by the PKIX <code class="codeph">CertPathValidator</code> or <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> implementation and a <code class="codeph">CertPathValidatorException</code> will be thrown. In this case, a developer can implement a <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> that recognizes and processes the critical private extension.
                              </p> 
                           </li>

                              <p>If the developer wants to record information about each certificate processed for debugging or display purposes.</p> 
                           </li>
                           <li> 
                              <p>If the user wants to reject certificates with certain policy qualifiers.</p> 
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The <code class="codeph">setCertPathCheckers</code> method of the <code class="codeph">PKIXParameters</code> class allows a user to pass a <code class="codeph">List</code> of <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> objects to a PKIX <code class="codeph">CertPathValidator</code> or <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> implementation. Each of the <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> objects will be called in turn, for each certificate processed by the PKIX <code class="codeph">CertPathValidator</code> or <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> implementation.

                           <p>The <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> class is abstract. It has four methods (<code class="codeph">check</code>, <code class="codeph">getSupportedExtensions</code>, <code class="codeph">init</code>, and <code class="codeph">isForwardCheckingSupported</code>) that all concrete subclasses must implement.
                           </p>
                           <p>Implementing a <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> may be trivial or complex. A <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> implementation can be stateless or stateful. A stateless implementation does not maintain state between successive calls of the <code class="codeph">check</code> method. For example, a <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> that checks that each certificate contains a particular policy qualifier is stateless. In contrast, a stateful implementation does maintain state between successive calls of the <code class="codeph">check</code> method. The <code class="codeph">check</code> method of a stateful implementation usually depends on the contents of prior certificates in the certification path. For example, a <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> that processes the NameConstraints extension is stateful.
                           </p>
                           <p>Also, the order in which the certificates processed by a service provider implementation are presented (passed) to a <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> is very important, especially if the implementation is stateful. Depending on the algorithm used by the service provider, the certificates may be presented in <span class="variable" translate="no">reverse</span> or <span class="variable" translate="no">forward</span> order. A reverse ordering means that the certificates are ordered from the most trusted CA (if present) to the target subject, whereas a forward ordering means that the certificates are ordered from the target subject to the most trusted CA. The order must be made known to the <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> implementation, so that it knows how to process consecutive certificates.

                           <p>The <code class="codeph">init</code> method initializes the internal state of the checker:

</code></pre><p>All stateful implementations should clear or initialize any internal state in the checker. This prevents a service provider implementation from calling a checker that is in an uninitialized state. It also allows stateful checkers to be reused in subsequent operations without reinstantiating them. The <code class="codeph">forward</code> parameter indicates the order of the certificates presented to the <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code>.

                           <p>The <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> class implements the <code class="codeph">Cloneable</code> interface. All stateful <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> implementations must override the <code class="codeph">clone</code> method if necessary. The default implementation of the <code class="codeph">clone</code> method calls the <code class="codeph">Object.clone</code> method, which performs a simple clone by copying all fields of the original object to the new object. A stateless implementation should not override the <code class="codeph">clone</code> method. However, all stateful implementations must ensure that the default <code class="codeph">clone</code> method is correct, and override it if necessary. For example, a <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> that stores state in an array must override the <code class="codeph">clone</code> method to make a copy of the array, rather than just a reference to the array.
                           </p>
                           <p>The reason that <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> objects are <code class="codeph">Cloneable</code> is to allow a PKIX <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> implementation to efficiently backtrack and try another path when a potential certification path reaches a dead end or point of failure. In this case, the implementation is able to restore prior path validation states by restoring the cloned objects.

                           </p><pre class="codeblock"><code>

</code></pre><p>If any of the <code class="codeph">check</code>s throw a <code class="codeph">CertPathValidatorException</code>, a <code class="codeph">CertPathValidator</code> implementation should terminate the validation procedure. However, a <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> implementation may simply log the failure and continue to search for other potential paths. If all of the <code class="codeph">check</code>s are successful, the service provider implementation should check that all critical extensions have been resolved and if not, consider the validation to have failed. For example:
                           </p><pre class="codeblock"><code>
        if (unresolvedCritExts != null &amp;&amp;

If the <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> implementation is validating the path as it is building it, it will need to restore the previous state of each <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code>. It can do this by making clones of the <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> objects <span class="variable" translate="no">before</span> each certificate is processed, for example:

                        <p>Using a <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathChecker</code> to customize certificate path validation is relatively straightforward.
                        </p>
                        <div class="section">
                           <p class="subhead3" id="GUID-F727578E-71D0-4BC5-9B06-47EE13F9CBCF__GUID-FDBBF84A-09BF-4E2A-B4DF-301F80CBC82F">Basic Certification Path Validation</p>
                           <p>First, consider code that validates a certificate path:</p><pre class="codeblock"><code>
Set&lt;TrustAnchor&gt; trustAnchors = getTrustAnchors();
CertPath cp = getCertPath();

PKIXParameters pkixp = new PKIXParameters(trustAnchors);
pkixp.setRevocationEnabled(false);

CertPathValidator cpv = CertPathValidator.getInstance("PKIX");
PKIXCertPathValidatorResult pcpvr =
    (PKIXCertPathValidatorResult)cpv.validate(cp, pkixp);
</code></pre><p>If the validation fails, the <code class="codeph">validate()</code> method throws an exception.
                           </p>
                           <p>The fundamental steps are as follows:</p>
                           <ol>
                              <li>Obtain the CA root certificates and the certification path to be validated.</li>
                              <li>Create a <code class="codeph">PKIXParameters</code> with the trust anchors.
                              </li>
                              <li>Use a <code class="codeph">CertPathValidator</code> to validate the certificate path.
                              </li>
                           </ol>
                           <p>In this example, <code class="codeph">getTrustAnchors()</code> and <code class="codeph">getCertPath()</code> are the methods that obtain CA root certificates and the certification path.
                           </p>
                           <p>The <code class="codeph">getTrustAnchors()</code> method in the example must return a <code class="codeph">Set</code> of <code class="codeph">TrustAnchor</code>s that represent the CA root certificates you wish to use for validation. Here is one simple implementation that loads a single CA root certificate from a file:
                           </p><pre class="codeblock"><code>
public Set&lt;TrustAnchor&gt; getTrustAnchors()
    throws IOException, CertificateException {

  CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");

  X509Certificate c;
  try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream("x509_ca-certificate.cer")) {
    c = (X509Certificate)cf.generateCertificate(in);
  }

  TrustAnchor anchor = new TrustAnchor(c, null);
  return Collections.singleton(anchor);
}
</code></pre><p>Similarly, here is a simple implementation of <code class="codeph">getCertPath()</code> that loads a certificate path from a file:
                           </p><pre class="codeblock"><code>
public CertPath getCertPath() throws IOException, CertificateException {
  CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");

  CertPath cp;
  try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream("certpath.pkcs7")) { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    cp = cf.generateCertPath(in, "PKCS7");
  }   
  return cp;
}
</code></pre><p>Note that PKCS#7 does not require a specific order for the certificates in the file, so this code only works for certification path validation when the certificates are ordered starting from the entity to be validated and progressing back toward the CA root. If the certificates are not in the right order, you need to do some additional processing. <code class="codeph">CertificateFactory</code> has a <code class="codeph">generateCertPath()</code> method that accepts a <code class="codeph">Collection</code>, which is useful for this type of processing.
                           </p>

The name of each SPI class is the same as that of the corresponding engine class, followed by "Spi". For example, the SPI class corresponding to the <code class="codeph">CertPathValidator</code> engine class is the <code class="codeph">CertPathValidatorSpi</code> class. Each SPI class is abstract. To supply the implementation of a particular type of service, for a specific algorithm or type, a provider must subclass the corresponding SPI class and provide implementations for all the abstract methods. For example, the <code class="codeph">CertStore</code> class provides access to the functionality of retrieving certificates and CRLs from a repository. The actual implementation supplied in a <code class="codeph">CertStoreSpi</code> subclass would be that for a specific type of certificate repository, such as LDAP.

                        <p>A provider should also document any relevant information regarding the <code class="codeph">CertStore</code> implementation (such as protocols used or formats supported). For example, an LDAP <code class="codeph">CertStore</code> implementation should describe which versions of LDAP are supported and which standard attributes are used for finding certificates and CRLs.

                        <p>If the implementation returns the certificates and CRLs in a particular order, it should describe the sorting algorithm. An implementation should also document any additional or default initialization parameters. Finally, an implementation should document if and how it uses information in the <code class="codeph">CertSelector</code> or <code class="codeph">CRLSelector</code> objects to find certificates and CRLs.

The <span class="apiname">setSigProvider</span> method of the <code class="codeph">PKIXParameters</code> class allows a user to specify a specific <code class="codeph">Signature</code> provider.

                        <p>Two implementations of the <code class="codeph">CertPathParameters</code> interface are included, the <code class="codeph">PKIXParameters</code> and <code class="codeph">PKIXBuilderParameters</code> classes. If you are working with PKIX certification path validation and algorithm parameters, you can utilize these classes. If you need parameters for a different algorithm, you will need to supply your own <code class="codeph">CertPathParameters</code> implementation for that algorithm.
                        </p>
                        <p>Two implementations of the <code class="codeph">CertStoreParameters</code> interface are included, the <code class="codeph">LDAPCertStoreParameters</code> and the <code class="codeph">CollectionCertStoreParameters</code> classes.

If you need parameters for a different repository type, you will need to supply your own <code class="codeph">CertStoreParameters</code> implementation for that type.

                        <p>The <code class="codeph">CertPathParameters</code> and <code class="codeph">CertStoreParameters</code> interfaces each define a <code class="codeph">clone</code> method that implementations should override. A typical implementation will perform a "deep" copy of the object, such that subsequent changes to the copy will not affect the original (and vice versa). However, this is not an absolute requirement for implementations of <code class="codeph">CertStoreParameters</code>. A shallow copy implementation of <code class="codeph">clone</code> is more appropriate for applications that need to hold a reference to a parameter contained in the <code class="codeph">CertStoreParameters</code>. For example, since <span class="apiname">CertStore.getInstance</span> makes a clone of the specified <code class="codeph">CertStoreParameters</code>, a shallow copy <code class="codeph">clone</code> allows an application to hold a reference to and later release the resources of a particular <code class="codeph">CertStore</code> initialization parameter, rather than waiting for the garbage collection mechanism. This should be done with the utmost care, since the <code class="codeph">CertStore</code> may still be in use by other threads.

                        <p>A PKIX implementation of a <code class="codeph">CertPathValidator</code> or a <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> may find it useful to store additional information in the <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathValidatorResult</code> or <code class="codeph">PKIXCertPathBuilderResult</code>, such as debugging traces.

                     <p>The "SUN" provider supplies a PKIX implementation of the <code class="codeph">CertPathValidator</code> engine class. The implementation validates <code class="codeph">CertPath</code>s of type X.509 and implements the certification path validation algorithm defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt" target="_blank">RFC 5280:</a> <cite>PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile</cite>. This implementation sets the <code class="codeph">ValidationAlgorithm</code> service attribute to "RFC5280".

                     <p>Weak cryptographic algorithms can be disabled in the "SUN" provider using the <code class="codeph">jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms</code> Security Property. See  <a href="java-pki-programmers-guide.html#GUID-D2A99DE3-62CF-4E4B-BF91-814C4A5C4DD3" title="The jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms Security Property contains a list of cryptographic algorithms and key size constraints that are considered weak or broken.

                     </p>
                     <p>The PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile has many optional features. The "SUN" provider implements support for the policy mapping, <a href="java-pki-programmers-guide.html#GUID-EB250086-0AC1-4D60-AE2A-FC7461374746__SECTION-1310-623E8D62">authority information access</a> and <a href="java-pki-programmers-guide.html#GUID-EB250086-0AC1-4D60-AE2A-FC7461374746__SECTION-139-623E860E">CRL distribution point certificate</a> extensions, the issuing distribution point CRL extension, and the reason code and certificate issuer CRL entry extensions. It does not implement support for the freshest CRL or subject information access certificate extensions. It also does not include support for the freshest CRL and delta CRL Indicator CRL extensions and the invalidity date and hold instruction code CRL entry extensions.
                     </p>
                     <p>The implementation supports a CRL revocation checking mechanism that conforms to section 6.3 of the PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile. OCSP (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2560.txt" target="_blank">RFC 2560</a>) is also currently supported as a built in revocation checking mechanism. See <a href="java-pki-programmers-guide.html#GUID-E6E737DB-4000-4005-969E-BCD0238B1566" title="Client-side support for the On-Line Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) as defined in RFC 2560 is supported.">Appendix C: OCSP Support</a> for more details on the implementation and configuration and how it works in conjunction with CRLs.
                     </p>
                     <p>The implementation does not support the <code class="codeph">nameConstraints</code> parameter of the <code class="codeph">TrustAnchor</code> class and the <code class="codeph">validate</code> method throws an <code class="codeph">InvalidAlgorithmParameterException</code> if it is specified.

                  <!-- class="section" -->
                  <div class="section">
                     <p class="subhead2" id="GUID-EB250086-0AC1-4D60-AE2A-FC7461374746__GUID-BB469A6A-18A4-40FF-BCAE-3320B9E75E01">CertPathBuilder</p>
                     <p> The "SUN" provider supplies a PKIX implementation of the <code class="codeph">CertPathBuilder</code> engine class. The implementation builds <code class="codeph">CertPath</code>s of type X.509. Each <code class="codeph">CertPath</code> is validated according to the PKIX algorithm defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt" target="_blank">RFC 5280: <span class="variable" translate="no">PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile</span></a>. This implementation sets the <code class="codeph">ValidationAlgorithm</code> service attribute to "RFC5280". 
                     </p>
                     <p>The implementation requires that the <code class="codeph">targetConstraints</code> parameter of a <code class="codeph">PKIXBuilderParameters</code> object is an instance of <code class="codeph">X509CertSelector</code> and the subject criterion is set to a non-null value. Otherwise the <code class="codeph">build</code> method throws an <code class="codeph">InvalidAlgorithmParameterException</code>.
                     </p>
                     <p>The implementation builds <code class="codeph">CertPath</code> objects in a forward direction using a depth-first algorithm. It backtracks to previous states and tries alternate paths when a potential path is determined to be invalid or exceeds the <code class="codeph">PKIXBuilderParameters</code> <code class="codeph">maxPathLength</code> parameter.
                     </p>
                     <p>Validation of the path is performed in the same manner as the <code class="codeph">CertPathValidator</code> implementation. The implementation validates most of the path as it is being built, in order to eliminate invalid paths earlier in the process. Validation checks that cannot be executed on certificates ordered in a forward direction are delayed and executed on the path after it has been constructed (but before it is returned to the application).
                     </p>
                     <p>As with <code class="codeph">CertPathValidator</code>, the <code class="codeph">jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms</code> Security Property can be used to exclude cryptographic algorithms that are not considered safe.
                     </p>
                     <p>When two or more potential certificates are discovered that may lead to finding a path that meets the specified constraints, the implementation uses the following criteria to prioritize the certificates (in the examples below, assume a <code class="codeph">TrustAnchor</code> distinguished name of "ou=D,ou=C,o=B,c=A" is specified):
                     </p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>The issuer DN of the certificate matches the DN of one of the specified <code class="codeph">TrustAnchor</code>s (ex: issuerDN = "ou=D,ou=C,o=B,c=A").
                        </li>
                        <li>The issuer DN of the certificate is a descendant of the DN of one of the <code class="codeph">TrustAnchor</code>s, ordered by proximity to the anchor (ex: issuerDN = "ou=E,ou=D,ou=C,o=B,c=A").
                        </li>
                        <li>The issuer DN of the certificate is an ancestor of the DN of one of the <code class="codeph">TrustAnchor</code>s, ordered by proximity to the anchor (ex: issuerDN = "ou=C,o=B,c=A".
                        </li>
                        <li>The issuer DN of the certificate is in the same namespace of one of the <code class="codeph">TrustAnchor</code>s, ordered by proximity to the anchor (ex: issuerDN = "ou=G,ou=C,o=B,c=A").
                        </li>
                        <li>The issuer DN of the certificate is an ancestor of the subject DN of the certificate, ordered by proximity to the subject.</li>
                     </ol>
                     <p> These are followed by certificates which don't meet any of the above criteria. </p>
                     <p>This implementation has been tested with the LDAP and Collection <code class="codeph">CertStore</code> implementations included in this release of the "SUN" provider.
                     </p>
                     <p>Debugging support can be enabled by setting the <code class="codeph">java.security.debug</code> property to <code class="codeph">certpath</code>. For example:
                     </p><pre class="codeblock"><code>

</code></pre><p> This will print additional debugging information to standard error. </p>

                     <p> The LDAP <code class="codeph">CertStore</code> implementation retrieves certificates and CRLs from an LDAP directory using the LDAP schema defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2587.txt" target="_blank">RFC 2587</a>.

                     <p>The implementation fetches certificates from different locations, depending on the values of the subject, issuer, and basicConstraints selection criteria specified in the <code class="codeph">X509CertSelector</code>. It performs as many of the following operations as possible:
                     </p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>Subject non-null, basicConstraints &lt;= -1 
                           <p>Looks for certificates in the subject DN's "userCertificate" attribute.</p> 
                        </li>
                        <li>Subject non-null, basicConstraints &gt;= -1 
                           <p>Looks for certificates in the forward element of the subject DN's "crossCertificatePair" attribute AND in the subject's "caCertificate" attribute.</p> 
                        </li>
                        <li>Issuer non-null, basicConstraints &gt;= -1 
                           <p>Looks for certificates in the reverse element of the issuer DN's "crossCertificatePair" attribute AND in the issuer DN's "caCertificate" attribute.</p> 
                        </li>
                     </ol>
                     <p>In each case, certificates are checked using <span class="apiname">X509CertSelector.match()</span> before adding them to the resulting collection.
                     </p>
                     <p>If none of the conditions specified above applies, then an exception is thrown to indicate that it was impossible to fetch certificates using the criteria supplied. Note that even if one or more of the conditions apply, the Collection returned may still be empty if there are no certificates in the directory.</p>
                     <p>The implementation fetches CRLs from the issuer DNs specified in the <span class="apiname">setCertificateChecking</span>, <span class="apiname">addIssuerName</span> or <span class="apiname">setIssuerNames</span> methods of the <code class="codeph">X509CRLSelector</code> class. If no issuer DNs have been specified using one of these methods, the implementation throws an exception indicating it was impossible to fetch CRLs using the criteria supplied. Otherwise, the CRLs are searched as follows:
                     </p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>
                           <p>The implementation first creates a list of issuer names. If a certificate was specified in the <span class="apiname">setCertificateChecking</span> method, it uses the issuer of that certificate. Otherwise, it uses the issuer names specified using the <span class="apiname">addIssuerName</span> or <span class="apiname">setIssuerNames</span> methods.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Next, the implementation iterates through the list of issuer names. For each issuer name, it searches first in the issuer's <code class="codeph">"authorityRevocationList"</code> attribute and then, if no matching CRL was found there, in the issuer's <code class="codeph">"certificateRevocationList"</code> attribute. One exception to the above is that if the issuer name was obtained from the certificate specified in the <span class="apiname">setCertificateChecking</span> method, it only checks the issuer's <code class="codeph">"authorityRevocationList"</code> attribute if the specified certificate is a CA certificate.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>All CRLs are checked using <span class="apiname">X509CRLSelector.match()</span> before adding them to the resulting collection.
